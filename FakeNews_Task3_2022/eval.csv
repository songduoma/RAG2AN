"You Can Be Fined $1,500 If Your Passenger Is Using A Mobile Phone, Starting Next Week","Distracted driving causes more deaths in Canada than impaired driving .It’s why every province and territory has laws against driving while operating a cell phone. “Tell your passengers to stay off their phones while you are driving. Such measures are more than necessary now, as distracted driving has claimed more lives than impaired driving in provinces like British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador. “Mobile phones, even when held by a passenger, can be a dangerous distraction for the driver. Starting next week being distracted by a screen held by a passenger attracts a penalty of $1,500 and three demerit points. “Drivers and screens do not mix – it doesn’t matter who is holding the device. Using FaceTime, taking selfies with the driver or showing the driver a funny cat video is a no-no.” In most provinces a mobile phone is categorised as a “visual display unit”, meaning it is considered akin to a television screen. It’s important to practice safe driving for your own sake and that of your fellow drivers. Canada is cracking down on its distracted driving problem with the rollout of stricter laws that impose harsher penalties and heftier fines on guilty offenders. It’s taking effect as of next week , and it adds serious penalties to those convicted of distracted driving.",false
Fields of human cages discovered in Caruthers California: Video,"FEMA camps, portable human cages, it's all real--all of it!  Screenshot via Twitter  In what can only be considered a completely communistic and diabolical plan to enslave the American people, a vast field containing what appears to be human cages outfitted with toilets was discovered in the California town of Caruthers.  Human holding cells appear to be packed into a desert field in somewhat of an organized fashion.  A number of rows and tiers of cells can be seen along with hundreds of mobile, truck outfitted, human holding tanks.

Kenny Rogers’ Wife Donates Half His Estate To Trump’s Re-Election: ‘It’s What He Would Have Wanted’,"“I love what he says, I have to admit.” That was what Kenny Rogers had to say about Donald Trump in 2015. Today, as the world mourns the loss of one of the greatest performers of all time, that sentiment will be shared in dollars. According to Sandy Batt, spokesperson for Kenny’s wife, Dominique Tubolls Rogers, Kenny’s estate will be split between his family — and Trump 2020:  “Kenny wanted Trump to win, so this is the best way for that to happen. Kenny has always been an island in the stream of Trump’s presidency. He once told him during a dinner in Palm Beach that there was no way he should ‘fold ’em and walk away.’ Trump told him not to worry.”  Rogers has already done more for the Trump campaign than most, offering free coleslaw to Trump campaign staff with the purchase of a half-chicken dinner at “Roasters,” and allowing them to refill their drink cups for half price. Staffers sent Kenny a thank you note once, telling how much they appreciated the gesture, as Trump paid them minimum wage and made no promises for White House jobs, though many of them now hold deputy cabinet positions.  We love you, Kenny Rogers. You will never be forgotten. The two songs we all know will play in our heads for at least a week. Thank you, Patriot, for all you do.",false
Police Stop Man From Dumping LSD Into L.A. Water Supply,"Police in Los Angeles have thwarted and apparent plot by a man to dump a whole bunch of hallucinogenic drugs into the city's water supply.  43-year-old Alexander S. Crow is a former chemist and used to work for Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. He stands accused of trying to dump 251-NBOMe, a synthetic drug that mimics LSD, into the water supply. He's a member of a group called Psychedelic Rainbow Warrior Peace Force, which aims to promote the legalization of such drugs.  After Crow's arrest, many members of the group confirmed to the LAPD that Crow had often spoke about introducing LSD into the water supply. They just dismissed it as a delusional fantasy. “He’d ramble on for hours about ways to introduce hallucinogens into the water supply and how he wanted the Russian government to finance his plans, a spokesperson said. We just laughed it off as mad talk.”  Crow wanted to awaken the universal love with each of us by drugging the entire city.",false
Wednesday 25 April 2018,"It is absolutely right that across this House we should all be absolutely clear in our determination to ensure that we stamp out racism in every form. Let me set out to the House the action that has been taken. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made very clear the offering in her statement to the House that those who came here before 1 January 1973 from Commonwealth countries—this is from Commonwealth countries as a whole—will be offered citizenship status without paying the fee and without taking the knowledge of language and “Life in the UK” test. The children of the Windrush generation who are in the UK will in most cases be British citizens already, but where that is not the case, they will be able to apply to naturalise at no further cost.  We are also taking action in relation to those who made their life here but retired to their country of origin and have found it difficult or impossible to return to the UK. We will work with high commissions to make sure that they can easily access the offer of formal British citizenship, because the Windrush generation are British; they are part of us. There will be a compensation scheme, the details of which my right hon. Friend will set out in due course, but I think everybody will see that the action the Government have taken is because we know the Windrush generation—[Interruption.] The Labour Front Benchers shake their heads and go, “Oh no!” The Windrush generation are British, they are part of us, and we will ensure that.",true
Skilled immigration to the UK will rise under reforms,"Skilled migration to the UK will rise under radical reforms to immigration that Boris Johnson signed off last week.  The prime minister and Priti Patel, the home secretary, met on Tuesday to finalise the details of Britain’s Australian-style points-based system, which will abolish the route into the UK for unskilled migrants from January 1 next year.  Sponsored  Home Office figures suggest the new rules will mean an overnight reduction in unskilled EU migrants of about 90,000 a year, who will no longer have a route into Britain.

Same-sex couple celebrates world’s first anal birth after successful rectal-ovary transplant,"A Los Angeles same-sex couple has successfully given birth anally to a healthy 8.2-pound baby for the first time in history.  The LGBTQ community worldwide has received the news of the rectal birth with open arms as the revolutionary medical procedure could enable millions of fertility-challenged couples to procreate.  James Bent, 37, received donated ovaries from his sister Leila Bent, 32, which were later successfully transplanted into his rectum and which enabled the anal birth to occur.  “I am so grateful to my sister, and to God, for making this natural birth a reality not only for us but for the millions of male same-sex couples which will follow in our path,” James Bent told reporters in tears.  “This medical procedure will not only be useful to male same-sex couples but also to heterosexual couples where the male partner wishes to experience the process of pregnancy for himself,” Dr. Peter Krisnawasti told reporters.  Other researchers believe that rectal-ovarian transplants could even be performed upon certain animals such as cows and pigs in the near future.  “It is not unimaginable that in the near future, fertility-challenged couples will be able to transplant their ovaries into the rectum of animals such as cows and pigs and bypass the pointless and painful hassle of the pregnancy process altogether” one researcher at California Hospital Medical Center explained when reached by phone.  Many analysts believe the revolutionary medical procedure performed under the supervision of Dr. Peter Krisnawasti could win the world-renowned surgeon the Nobel Prize in medicine.",false

Trump Signs Executive Order Making Flag Burning a Hate Crime,"Burning the flag of the USA is protected free speech. It’s legal. The issue has been heard by the Supreme Court of the United States and has been settled. That’s it. We have to accept it, no matter how distasteful.  President Trump has also made his peace with this even though he hates it with every fiber of his being. But Trump is a thinker. He’s shrewd and he fights for what’s right by taking the winded road if a straight line is not available. And he’s come through again with yet another piece of brilliant, innovative thinking. This is why we elected him.  President Trump has now signed Executive Order Number 3275 and put its contents into law. It states:  “The destruction or desecration of the flag of the United States of America, in any way shape or form, whether through burning, cutting, shredding, or any other means the court may deem fitting, will hereafter be classified as a hate crime, punishable under the American Hate Crimes statute, with identical sentencing guidelines.”  Criminal behavior charged as a hate crime carries a much stricter punishment than those without the classification. Flag burners may now face up to 50 years in prison upon conviction.  This Presidential Order is an effective workaround of the Supreme Court’s decision regarding free speech. While Trump was not able to reject the court’s previous ruling, he was legally able to make this new designation. Haters of this country beware. Your time is up.",false

Army Scientists Successfully Teleport Soldiers From Massachusetts to Germany,"According to the Natick Soldier Systems Center NSSC, scientists have managed to successfully teleport a fully equipped squad from Massachusetts to a training area in Germany.  Teleportation is the process of moving objects from one place to another thanks to the transformation of matter into energy and its subsequent reconstruction based on Einstein’s famous formula.  We must take into account that there is no direct relation between teleportation as defined in science-fiction, and quantum teleportation, which is a technical-scientific term used in quantum physics to denote information transport.  The idea of teleportation became famous thanks to the Star Trek 1996 series. In that series, characters moved from their ship to other planets with incredible ease. At the same time, A Mosca was influenced by the tale of George Langelaan and studied the idea and constructed equipment that allowed the teleportation of matter in 1958.  Watch the below video for more info about this teleportation technology created by army scientists.  VIDEO:  © Alien News",false
“Catastrophic” effect of rail privatisation revealed 25 years on,"Figures released today, the 25th anniversary of the legislation that privatised British Rail receiving Royal Assent, show the full cost of privatisation for both passengers and the taxpayer.  Government direct subsidy of the railways is around £5 billion per year, an increase of over 200% since privatisation  An additional £4.1 billion per year of public money is pumped into the railways as increased debt for Network Rail  Fares across all operators are 20% higher in real terms than they were in January 1995  A peak time single from London to Manchester has gone up by 238%, up from £50 in 1995 to £169 today and a single to Exeter was £37.50 but is now £129.50 – a rise of 245%.  Andy McDonald MP, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary, commenting on the catastrophic failure of rail privatisation 25 years on, said:  “Twenty-five years on it’s clear that rail privatisation has been a catastrophic failure, with the taxpayer putting in even more money to the privatised system than when it was nationalised.  “Labour will take our railways into public ownership to improve services and cap fares, running them in the interest of passengers, not for private profit.”",true
House Democrats Move to Remove National Anthem from Sporting Events,"The Star-Spangled Banner is America’s song. It represents us all, regardless of our skin color, beliefs, or political leanings. This is why it is shocking to hear that House Democrats moved to hold a vote on removing the national anthem before sporting events, citing its offensiveness to people from other countries.  The bill is expected to easily pass as all professional sports events have been suspended indefinitely.  Ilhan Omar says the move was inspired by professional kneeler Colin Kaepernick. She says he spoke to her recently and inspired her to act:  “We had a meeting with Colin Kaepernick a few weeks ago and he talked to us about criminal justice reform and ways we can help. He suggested that we should ban the national anthem before football games since it offends so many people. We are taking his advice because we respect the wishes of people with other beliefs. We will have the national anthem banned. It’s not representative of America.”  Republicans are not having it. They are riled up over this news. Senator Joe Barron issued this statement:  “We will not allow this nonsense to go forward. The national anthem is very relevant to sporting events. It should be said thrice a day in fact. We will be pushing a bill to make it mandatory to be sung at all schools and workplaces in the nation thrice daily. The song represents freedom, so we will require it. It’s mandatory.”  It’s good to see at least some in Congress are looking out for the rights of real Americans. If these Democrats are offended by America, then maybe they should pack their bags. There are many Americans willing to help them pack.",false
HUGE SCANDAL: Oregon Changes Hundreds Of Republican Ballots To “Non Partisan” Denying GOP Voters the Right To Participate In Primary,"Disturbing news is coming out of Oregon, as hundreds of people are reporting that their voter registration was switched from Republican to non affiliated without their knowledge or permission.

Many were shocked to open their ballot to find that they were no longer with the party they thought they were with, and they received non partisan ballots. As Oregon is a closed primary state, this effectively denies these people the right to vote in the party’s primary that they thought they were registered as.

Clinton Foundation Investigator Kenneth McCormick Found Dead,"The Clinton body count continues to grow. Clinton Foundation investigator and prosecutor Kenneth McCormick was found dead today in the driveway of his home in South Park, Colorado under extremely mysterious circumstances.  According to reliable sources in the Department of Justice, Mr. McCormick was in the final phase of his investigation into criminal activity by both Bill and Hillary Clinton and was about to indict the former president and first lady on federal crimes.  According to South Park police, McCormick was found by his next-door neighbors, Stan Marsh and Eric Cartman, laying decapitated in a pool of blood after having apparently committed suicide with a pair of cordless hedge clippers. Munching on a bag of Cheesy Poofs, Eric Cartman lamented the untimely demise of his neighbor and best friend:  “Oh my god! They killed Kenny! Those bastards! Everyone in the neighborhood knew something was up when we started to see those black SUV’s with Clinton Foundation stickers slowly driving up and down our street a few weeks ago. We tried to warn him, but Kenny just wouldn’t listen. He kept mumbling something about Uranium One and that he couldn’t talk about it.”  DOJ spokesman Joe Barron vowed that justice would be served:  “Mark my words: we will find Kenny McCormick’s killer. Attorney General Barr has made this our highest priority. It’s Seth Rich and Vince Foster all over again. This heinous crime will not stand. We already have several suspects with ties to the Clinton Foundation in custody. It is only a matter of time before we get to the bottom of this matter.”  Click on Kenny below for some really cool South Park cakes in memory of Kenny!",false
China Bought Dominion In October,"China Bought Dominion In October — It’s not a theory when you have the documentation. Just saying that for my conspiracy theory fans.  Staple Street Capital III, L.P. sold $400 million in securities to UBS Securities Co., Ltd. as reveled 12:15 today, Dec. 1, by attorney Lin Wood in a cryptic tweet to a link to the sale’s SEC Form D.  The SEC Form D was filed Oct. 8.  Form D is the required notice for companies that have sold securities without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 under certain conditions.  The filing must be within 15 days of the sale.  Staple Street Capital is the New York-based, private equity firm that acquired Dominion Voting Systems in July 2018.  Dominion voting machines were used in 28 states, Nov. 3.  Many think they could be programmed to flip votes from one candidate to another or delete votes for an undesired candidate.

Nancy Pelosi Retiring – Won’t Seek Re-Election in 2020,"Nancy Pelosi’s office spent the day denying what her own daughters spilled earlier this week at a kegger in San Dimas: Speaker Pelosi will NOT be seeking another term as a US Congresswoman. According to Brandon Kyle, a friend of Cassandra Pelosi:  “She totally said her mom was retiring. Like…30 people heard it. Her sister Marisol was upstairs doing that thing she does with a Zagnut and confirmed it to at least 16 girls and one undecided that we know of.”  When asked how credible the source was, we were told “regardless of how credible the source is, the information is true,” which explains everything.  The mainstream media has been told not to report it.  That won’t stop the truth from getting out, however, as more people find Cassie’s story and hunt down Kyle. Our own investigator in the field, Skip Tetheluda, says he found the sources to be fully credible:  “I went expecting to find a bunch of losers looking to score some cash on inside info and instead found a bunch of complete idiots who didn’t understand how valuable their information was. I sat and burned one with Mikey and Rich and they gave me the whole scoop. Yeah, she’s retiring all right.”  Skip’s reputation is unmatched in our circles, so we’re gonna go ahead and pass this information along.

Democrats Tried to Slip a Law Banning Pledge of Allegiance Into Aid Package,"In stunning new findings released by the Dunning-Kruger Institute, Democrats were found to have added provisions to ban the Pledge of Allegiance, into the emergency aid package. The language, added by Pelosi and Schumer, was very clear of its intention:  “The passing of this legislative package will also outlaw the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance in all schools in the United States. This statute will go into effect immediately upon this bill’s passage. Anyone found guilty of reciting the Pledge will be charged with grand heresy, and punished by up to 10 years in a federal penitentiary and a fine of no less than $20,000.”  Republicans Senator Joe Barron slammed the news:  “Democrats bad, Republicans good. It’s really that simple. Everything is simple like that in life.”  The Democrats thought they were sneaky, adding this nonsense into the aid bill. The Republicans were too smart, however, and the foolish Democrat plot was foiled. Republicans are a party of literacy and read they did. They read the bill in its entirety to check for traps like this laid by the Democrats.  It’s also a sad state of affairs that the Democrats would use such a bill, one for emergency relief, to push their leftist communist agenda. Can’t they just stop playing politics for one day and pass a bill for the American people? I guess not. They will never change. They need to be removed and replaced with Republicans that represent the people.",false

Evidence from the Apollo 20 mission – Alien City found and examined,"This all happened in April of 2007 as a few videos began emerging out of nowhere all over the internet. The videos all took place around the Delporte crater from the Moon where this massive cigar-shaped alien ship can be observed.  The videos were all taken during the Apollo 20 mission which in case you didn’t know by now was a secret mission meant to give NASA the opportunity to collect ancient alien technology from the Moon.  This may seem hard to believe at first if you’re not accustomed to the conspiracy theory, but there is plenty of proof to back it up, including William Rutledge and his incredible story depicting the whole incident.  A whopping 14 photos were also taken from the area, alongside this three-minute video showcasing the cigar-shaped ship emerging from inside of the crater.  William Rutledge also brought up this massive city that was discovered on the Moon in Video 1. He uploaded it on his YouTube channel nicknamed “Retiredafb” and it garnered over 1.5 million views by now before it was deleted by the NSA.  A second video that he uploaded showcases the Alien Girl E.B.E Mona Lisa TV unscheduled transmission which showcases this strange recording of an alien that was meant to be shown on live TV before NASA took a hold of it and hid it from us.

"WATCH: Bill Gates Admits His COVID-19 Vaccine Might KILL Nearly 1,000,000 People – The Clover Chronicle","Microsoft co-founder and “philanthropist” Bill Gates recently admitted his vaccine for coronavirus COVID-19 is less effective in the elderly and will most likely result in the death or maiming of 700,000 people. Watch below timestamp 2:35 – Partial transcript: “…The efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge. It turns out the flu vaccine isn’t that effective in elderly people. Most of the benefit comes from younger people not spreading it because they’re vaccinated, and that benefits, on a community basis, the elderly. “Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that. And doing that so you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects. If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that’s way more, 700,000 people who will suffer from that. “So, really understanding the safety at gigantic scales across all age ranges – you know pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities – it’s very, very hard, and that actual decision of ‘okay, let’s go and give this vaccine to the entire world,’ governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.”",false

Democrats Want Stimulus Payments Taken from Social Security and Military,"Recently, the most generous economic stimulus payments in the history of our great nation were announced. An overwhelming percentage of the people will get $1,200 each, including our senior citizens and our tremendous military members and President Trump was proud to sign the bill, which will offer relief to millions.  Enter the socialist Democrats. Rarely pennywise and always pound-foolish, they have unilaterally decided that those who are on Social Security and members of the military already make enough money and that these payments will be preemptively taken from their upcoming pay.  Obviously this will have effect of making it difficult for those people to live until they get their government bailout. Seniors will be eating cat food. Soldiers will be eating each other.

Bibles Pulled From Shelves For Outdated Idea That All Humans Are Of One Race And Made In The Image Of God,"Bibles Pulled From Shelves For Outdated Idea That All Humans Are Of One Race And Made In The Image Of God  U.S.—Online and brick and mortar booksellers across the country* will no longer be selling the Bible due to its outdated depictions of humanity all being of one race and made in the image of God.  The Bible has long been controversial when it comes to race, suggesting that Jesus Christ can break down barriers between people groups through the blood of His cross and callously proclaiming that everyone is made in God's image and has inherent dignity and worth because of God's infinite worth.  We're trying to stoke racial tensions, and the Bible is extremely unhelpful at a time like this, said one activist. Pulling the book will go a long way toward progressing the race war. If everyone believed what the Bible said, we'd have no racial divisions to exploit. Can you imagine all the peace and harmony that would break out?

"Breaking News: Charged With Crimes Against Humanity, Intent To Commit Mass Genocide: Bill Gates, Melinda Gates, Anthony Fauci, Christine Grady, Tedros Adhanom","While youre distracted with riots and protesting and the medias over reaction to covid and one sided stories of riots and not the peaceful protestors, Obama was in court yesterday, I heard with no verification Hillary was today, and up next is the CDC, WHO, Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci, amongst others on the 5th, and then the Rothischilds on the 12th. Whilst the media plays its cards for the Dems and the Elite as well as the NWO very well, pay attention to whats going on beyond the tv behind the scenes.

Chairman Mackowiak supports Gov. Abbott in opposing Austin homeless camp ordinance,"A recent change to city ordinance allowing homeless camps along private property, business frontage, and even public sidewalks has ignited a firestorm from both sides of the political spectrum.    It has now become legal in the City of Austin for homeless persons to camp on the front of one's private property or on public rights-of-way in the Capital of Texas. Even the Austin Police Association is expressing discomfort with the idea, which allows camping on sidewalks, alleyways, and other public places except parks and City Hall, which includes in front of your house, provided the people camping are not making the sidewalk unreasonably inconvenient or hazardous.    This ill-advised homeless camping policy is the latest example of our all-Democrat City Council continuing its war on private enterprise and taxpayers, said Matt Mackowiak, Travis GOP Chairman. There are better ways to incentivize businesses and homeowners to help alleviate homelessness in Austin, but chiseling away at our rights and public safety is not the answer.",false
Capitol Shooting Exposed as Hollywood Stunt,"% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.      Ashli Babbit Capitol Shooting Exposed as Hollywood Stunt  Compelling analysis of video clips reveal a botched attempt at a Hollywood-style capitol shooting drama.  Is Ashli Babbitt alive and well? — Babbit was initially identified as “Roberta Paulsen” until it was officially debunked by alleged “fact checkers”.  The smoking gun is the failure of law enforcement to be prepared when it was known by U.S. Capitol Police, that alleged “insurrection” at the capitol was planned for weeks by people and groups claiming to be Trump supporters but now revealed to be hired actors.

Ten minutes’ exercise each week cuts risk of early death,"A study found that activities such as gardening, walking briskly or dancing lowered people’s risk of dying within 10 years  People who take a walk of between ten and 59 minutes once a week are 18 per cent less likely to die within a decade, a study has found.  The more time people spent on activities such as gardening, walking briskly or dancing, the lower their chances of dying within the period, researchers found. Vigorous exercise such as running or playing sport appeared to bring even greater benefits.  Sponsored  Health chiefs said that the study reinforced the idea that any physical activity was better than none.

President Trump Files Two Lawsuits Against Dirty Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger for Leaking Confidential Litigation Call,"The travesty in Georgia continues. President Trump held a one-hour long phone call on Saturday with crooked Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and state election officials on the 2020 election in his state that was wrought with fraud. It’s not clear if Ruby Freeman or Ralph Jones, Sr. were on the call. In the one-hour phone call on Saturday, President Trump insisted he won the state and threatened vague legal consequences. Raffensperger’s team leaked the call to the far-left Washington Post. It took 24 hours for the Washington Post to publish a hit piece, using edited audio clips, on the president’s phone call. Georgia Republican chairman David Shafer later announced that President Trump and his team filed two lawsuits against Secretary of State Raffensperger. David Shafer: President Donald Trump has filed two lawsuits – federal and state – against Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. This was after Raffensperger secretly recorded the “confidential settlement discussion” of that litigation that is still pending. The audio published by the Washington Post is heavily edited and omits the stipulation that all discussions were for the purpose of settling litigation and confidential under federal and state law. Dirtbag Brad Raffensperger is in serious trouble. What is with this guy? Why is he so determined to defend the massive fraud in his state?

Nancy Pelosi: I Am Ready To Take My Rightful Place As President Of These United States,"Nancy Pelosi has said that she is ready to take her rightful place as President of the United States should the election not be decided by next year. She is concerned that the votes will be counted in time and that she will be the ruler of this country.  She’s also taking steps to prepare the house to vote should the electric not be able to form a majority for President of the United States. This is something that hasn’t been done in over 118 years.  If the electorate cannot name a majority candidate for president, the House then turns to vote for the President and the Senate for the VP. Knowing Nancy, if she was to take over as president of the United States we would all be in deep shit.  She already wants to stack the court and legalize abortion. It’s unclear how long she would actually have as president but you can expect that she would do whatever she could to destroy this great country.  We would not be safe.

Twitter Shuts Down Entire Network To Slow Spread Of Negative Biden News,"Twitter Shuts Down Entire Network To Slow Spread Of Negative Biden News  SAN FRANCISCO, CA—In a last-ditch effort to stop negative stories about Joe Biden and his family from spreading, Twitter shut down its entire social network Thursday.  After seeing account after account tweet out one particularly bad story, CEO Jack Dorsey realized he had to take action. Dorsey smashed a glass box in his office reading Break In Case Of Bad Publicity For Democrats. Inside the case was a sledgehammer for smashing Twitter's servers.  Red alert -- shut the servers down! Shut them all down!  Dorsey ran downstairs and started smashing as many computers as he could, but he did need to ask for some help, as the hammer was pretty heavy. None of the programmers could lift the hammer, either. Eventually, they managed to program a robot to pick up the sledgehammer and smash the servers.  After hearing the Twitter employees talk about critical theory, the robot got woke and began attacking all the cis white males.  Babylon Bee subscriber Jackson Baker contributed to this report.

My research into the NCBI database for nucleotide sequences has lead to a stunning discovery. One of the WHO primer sequences in the PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is found in all human DNA!  The sequence “CTCCCTTTGTTGTGTTGT” is an 18-character primer sequence found in the WHO coronavirus PCR testing protocol document. The primer sequences are what get amplified by the PCR process in order to be detected and designated a “positive” test result. It just so happens this exact same 18-character sequence, verbatim, is also found on Homo sapiens chromosome 8! As far as I can tell, this means that the WHO test kits should find a positive result in all humans. Can anyone explain this otherwise?  I really cannot overstate the significance of this finding.

In a twitter video that has since gone viral online, the Doctor was seen advising men to have sex at least 21 times a month in order to check against prostate cancer.  She said her advise is as a result of research findings conducted at Harvard University which was published in a journal called the European Urology.  The research found that men who have frequent sex, do not have the chance to suffer prostate cancer hence others should follow in the same act, she added.  “We found that men reporting higher compared to lower ejaculatory frequency in adulthood were less likely to be subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer.  This large prospective study provides the strongest evidence to date of a beneficial role of ejaculation in the prevention of prostate cancer,” the researchers said.",false

Trump Issues Order Deeming Church An Essential Business,"America is a Christian nation and the most essential part of the lives of Americans is going to church. Without this, we are just a land of savages like other places that have rejected Christianity.  Just look at Nazi Germany and New Zealand. These places are not places we want to be like, but without God in our lives, we soon will be headed down that path.  Our President Donald Trump understands this more than anyone. That is why he has worked so hard on crafting his most recent Executive Order. It will allow churches to operate as the essential businesses that they are.  Executive Order 66 states the following:  “As of today, all churches in the United States of America are classified as essential businesses. This will require them to remain open for all people at all times. In addition, since they are now classified as businesses, they will be entitled to taxation provisions by the IRS. In essence, they will now pay the taxes they have been avoiding for all these years.”  This is great news for Americans. They can get back to church and God will be back. The best part of this order for America is the taxation provisions. The nation will have so much revenue, we won’t know what to do with it. We will pay off the debt in record time, just as Trump claimed.  The president is said to be working on a new Executive Order, opening up the rest of the country as soon as possible.

Sen. Van Wanggaard: Statement on statewide mask mandate,"“You can’t legislate common sense. For that reason, I continue to strongly oppose the one-size-fits all approach of Governor Evers’ response to coronavirus in this state, including the statewide mask mandate.

At a time when liberals across Wisconsin are trying to prevent arrests and fines for actual crimes committed, the last thing law enforcement needs to do is enforce mask wearing. It is the definition of misplaced priorities. This is especially true given the under-reporting of negative cases in at least two counties with high infection rates.  I can understand why some businesses are requiring masks. That is their choice, just as it is my choice to do business elsewhere. That’s what America is about. But no one is going to make me wear a mask in my house, or walking my dog. That is also what America is about – free choice.",false
Pelosi To Seniors: ‘You Are Not Entitled To Social Security! It’s Gone!’,"Socialist politicians in the Democratic Party have tried for years to eliminate Social Security, a source of income relied upon by millions in this country just to get by in their old age. Why they would pursue this is quite simple – they think of nobody but themselves. Their retirement income is guaranteed through fat congressional pensions in addition to the billions they steal from the taxpayer during their terms in office, so they have no worries.  Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, today launched their latest attack on our beloved social safety net:  “Seniors in this country are soft! They actually rely on this pittance from the government in their latter years! Well guess what, people? This country is in trouble! We face financial ruin and hard choices have to be made about our money. Our situation is totally unsustainable because of the massive amounts of dough that our esteemed leader is adding to the debt. Something has to give. Someone is going to suffer and, since, you all aren’t exactly contributing anymore, I see no reason why it shouldn’t be you. You voted for him you stupid boomers! And you didn’t plan your lives well! You wasted everything! Time to pay the piper.”  This is typical of the rhetoric from the democrats as they always try to blame the fiscally responsible republicans of this country for their failures. We are fortunate that we have President Trump to fight back against this socialist horde and protect our citizens. Nancy’s talk while Trump is in the White House is just that ……talk.",false
Democrats Tried to Slip a Law Banning Pledge of Allegiance Into Aid Package,"In stunning new findings released by the Dunning-Kruger Institute, Democrats were found to have added provisions to ban the Pledge of Allegiance, into the emergency aid package. The language, added by Pelosi and Schumer, was very clear of its intention:  “The passing of this legislative package will also outlaw the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance in all schools in the United States. This statute will go into effect immediately upon this bill’s passage. Anyone found guilty of reciting the Pledge will be charged with grand heresy, and punished by up to 10 years in a federal penitentiary and a fine of no less than $20,000.”  Republicans Senator Joe Barron slammed the news:  “Democrats bad, Republicans good. It’s really that simple. Everything is simple like that in life.”  The Democrats thought they were sneaky, adding this nonsense into the aid bill. The Republicans were too smart, however, and the foolish Democrat plot was foiled. Republicans are a party of literacy and read they did. They read the bill in its entirety to check for traps like this laid by the Democrats.  It’s also a sad state of affairs that the Democrats would use such a bill, one for emergency relief, to push their leftist communist agenda. Can’t they just stop playing politics for one day and pass a bill for the American people? I guess not. They will never change.

Report: National Guard Turned Backs on Biden Motorcade,"Members of the US National Guard refused to acknowledge Joe Biden as his motorcade drove by following his inauguration, footage shows.  Instead of turning to face the new president, several members of the National Guard tasked with providing security for the event turned their backs to him as the presidential motorcade made its way to the US Capitol.

Study: Marijuana could be making teens less intelligent,"HOUSTON — In Texas, marijuana is illegal, and a Duke University study says using it can make you less smart.  For decades, researchers studied more than 1,000 people in New Zealand. They found teenagers who use marijuana at least four days a week lost 8 IQ points between the ages of 13 and 38.  Here's the key: that same thing didn't happen for people who heavily smoked marijuana only as adults. Heavy pot smokers did show deficits in memory, concentration and just overall brainpower. But all those effects were much worse among those who started lighting up as teens.  So is an 8-point IQ loss significant? Researchers say you bet. A person's long-term job prospects, job performance an income could be impacted, too.  Researchers can't say for certain marijuana is the sole reason those IQs took a hit. A competing study found a person's socioeconomic status could also be to blame for the IQ slide.  RELATED: Could marijuana law reform come to Texas this year?

‘Daughters of the Confederacy’ Sues Nascar for Violating 1st Amendment,"The First Amendment is listed first for a reason, and that reason is simple. It is because it is the most important freedom that all other freedoms stem from. Without the ability to speak your mind, you would not have any freedom at all. This greatest amendment prevents companies from telling you what you can or can’t say, which is precisely why they are being sued by the Daughters of the Confederacy organization.  A spokesperson for the organization, Sandy Batt, issued this statement to the press:  “Nascar is in direct violation of our First Amendment right to freedom of speech. You would think such a large organization that employs hundreds of lawyers would understand the Constitution, especially the First Amendment and how it applies to companies.

"Joe Arpaio, America’s Toughest Sheriff, Dead at 89","Joe Arpaio, former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, has died at the age of 89. Best known for being sued for various violations of the Constitution, not investigating sexual crimes against children, buying a tank, ignoring court orders, being incoherent at the 2016 Republican National Convention, and spying on a Federal judge’s wife, the former Sheriff was seeking to be back in the public eye.  The former sheriff was focused on being re-elected, believing the voters of the county to be gullible fools who missed him. Since Arizona voted for Donald Trump in 2016, he definitely had a chance.  Arpaio reportedly collapsed when he tried to chase a brown person out of his neighborhood in the Maryvale district of Phoenix.  County coroner Joe Barron performed the autopsy and spoke with our own Glenn Stanley,  “We were floored. We were thinking heart attack. We couldn’t find a heart, nor any evidence that there ever was a heart in Arpaio’s body.  It turns out that the actual cause of death was due to a lack of anyone paying attention to him. After he was pardoned by Trump for investigating a judge, he had a laughable run for Senate.  After everyone was done laughing at him, he faded into fatal obscurity.”  The burial of the Sheriff is expected to be attended by 3 or 4 people, including David Duke and Pamela Geller, who are afraid of the same things that Arpaio also hated.  President Trump reached out with a note to Joe Arpaio to get well but then retracted saying, “I like former sheriffs that didn’t die.”",false
Belgium Health Minister puts ban on non-essential sexual activities of persons 3 or greater in indoor areas,"Belgium Health Minister Maggie de Block has put a ban on all non-essential sexual activities of persons 3 or greater in indoor areas.  Health Minister de Block announced today that, effective immediately, “non-essential” sexual activities of 3 people or more are banned in Belgium to combat the spread of COVID-19.  De Block said she was forced to act swiftly because of Belgium’s reputation as being the “beer-drinking” and “group sex capital of Europe.”  “Belgium is the beer-drinking and group sex capital of Europe, if not the world. We, as a nation, must address this situation,” De Block announced in Parliament.  Belgium Health minister has put a ban on all sexual activities of three people or more after a coronavirus party last week turned into a 500-participant orgy and ended with 380 cases of contamination.  “Wife swapping, threesomes, and orgies of six, fifty, one hundred or more are not permitted until the outbreak settles down,” she announced in Parliament.  Health minister De Block did not ban single or two-person sexual practices such as masturbation, anal or oral sex, or even bestiality.  “These measures apply only to human-to-human sexual contact, not human-to-animal contact,” she added when questioned about bestiality by reporters.  A 2018 survey revealed that more than 78% of Belgian couples openly practice wife swapping, a cultural trait that became common practice in the 19th century under the rule of King Leopold II.  .",false

Dan Jarvis: Winter death toll should shame coldest of hearts,"The number of homeless people in Japan has dropped to a 15-year low below 5,000, according to the welfare ministry, which credited municipal and prefectural efforts to help them regain independence. As of January, the ministry said Friday, 4,977 people were living in places such as riverbeds or parks, down 557 from a year ago and under 5,000 for the first time since it began surveying the ranks of the homeless in 2003. “Support measures from governments, such as counseling, are believed to have produced certain effects” that reduced the number of homeless people, a ministry official said. The survey was conducted by having local officials patrol communities to spot people without permanent dwellings. More than 90 percent of the total, or 4,607, were men and 177 were women, but the sex of the remaining 193 was left blank as they were bundled up in clothing when they were found. Three-quarters of the homeless were observed in Tokyo’s 23 wards or other major cities. Tokyo had 1,242 homeless, followed by Osaka with 1,110 and Kanagawa with 934. Six other prefectures — Aomori, Akita, Yamagata, Nara, Shimane and Nagasaki — reported no homeless people. The ministry noted, however, that the actual number could be higher because the survey was based on informal observations. A homeless person would not have been included, for example, if he or she was elsewhere when officials strolled by to scan the parks and train stations.",true
United Airlines Flight Attendant Slaps Crying Baby During Flight,"During a flight from New York City to Chicago, violence erupted after a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy. This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday. The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.” After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee. The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired. The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. The parents say they are reaching out to an attorney, refusing to give any further statements.",false

The Texas State Senate – Senator Paul Bettencourt: District 7,"U.S. military officials worked to ensure President Trump wouldn’t see the warship that bears the name of the late senator, a frequent target of the president’s ire. A tarp obscures the name of the USS John S. McCain ahead of President Trump's visit to Japan. The White House wanted the U.S. Navy to move “out of sight” the warship USS John S. McCain ahead of President Trump’s visit to Japan, according to an email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The ship was named after the father and grandfather of the late senator—a war hero who became a frequent target of Mr. Trump’s ire—and the senator’s name was added to the ship in 2018. In a May 15 email to U.S. Navy and Air Force officials, a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command official outlined plans for the president’s arrival that he said had resulted from conversations between the White House Military Office and the Seventh Fleet of the U.S. Navy. In addition to instructions for the proper landing areas for helicopters and preparation for the USS Wasp—where the president was scheduled to speak—the official issued a third directive: “USS John McCain needs to be out of sight.” “Please confirm #3 will be satisfied,” the official wrote.

"The World Health Organization has finally confirmed what we (and many experts and studies) have been saying for months – the coronavirus is no more deadly or dangerous than seasonal flu. The WHO’s top brass made this announcement during a special session of the WHO’s 34-member executive board on Monday October 5th, it’s just nobody seemed to really understand it. In fact, they didn’t seem to completely understand it themselves. At the session, Dr Michael Ryan, the WHO’s Head of Emergencies revealed that they believe roughly 10% of the world has been infected with Sars-Cov-2. This is their “best estimate”, and a huge increase over the number of officially recognised cases (around 35 million). Dr. Margaret Harris, a WHO spokeswoman, later confirmed the figure, stating it was based on the average results of all the broad seroprevalence studies done around the world. As much as the WHO were attempting to spin this as a bad thing – Dr Ryan even said it means “the vast majority of the world remains at risk.” – it’s actually good news. And confirms, once more, that the virus is nothing like as deadly as everyone predicted. The global population is roughly 7.8 billion people, if 10% have been infected that is 780 million cases. The global death toll currently attributed to Sars-Cov-2 infections is 1,061,539. That’s an infection fatality rate of roughly or 0.14%. Right in line with seasonal flu and the predictions of many experts from all around the world. 0.14% is over 24 times LOWER than the WHO’s “provisional figure” of 3.4% back in March. This figure was used in the models which were used to justify lockdowns and other draconian policies. In fact, given the over-reporting of alleged Covid deaths, the IFR is likely even lower than 0.14%, and could show Covid to be much less dangerous than flu. None of the mainstream press picked up on this. Though many outlets reported Dr Ryan’s words, they all attempted to make it a scary headline and spread more panic. Apparently neither they, nor the WHO, were capable of doing the simple math that shows us this is good news. And that the Covid sceptics have been right all along.","NPR’s sites use cookies, similar tracking and storage technologies, and information about the device you use to access our sites (together, “cookies”) to enhance your viewing, listening and user experience, personalize content, personalize messages from NPR’s sponsors, provide social media features, and analyze NPR’s traffic.

,"Elisa Granato, the first volunteer who availed herself in Oxford for a jab in the first Europe human trial of a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus pandemic has died. She died two days after the vaccine was administered, authorities have said and added that an investigation into the cause of the death has been initiated. A statement by the researchers said Elisa had complications few hours after taking the vaccine and died while on admission. Elisa Granato, who is a scientist, was one of the two who received the jab. Four other volunteer are said to be battling complications due to adverse reactions of the vaccine. Officials say the four persons are being monitored against any adverse effects of the vaccine. After taking her shot, Elisa Granato told the BBC: “I’m a scientist, so I wanted to try to support the scientific process wherever I can.” Researchers who are awaiting for an autopsy to be conducted believe the Elisa had an underlying health condition which was not disclosed to health officials. “The four in critical conditions will be fine and these are expected reactions from the vaccines, hence a trial.” the researchers revealed and added that these observations would help improve on the vaccine before it becomes available for use by the public.",false
"A recent study in the journal Cancer Discovery found that inhalation of harmful microbes can contribute to advanced stage lung cancer in adults. Long-term use of face masks may help breed these dangerous pathogens. Microbiologists agree that frequent mask wearing creates a moist environment in which microbes are allowed to grow and proliferate before entering the lungs. Those foreign microbes then travel down the trachea and into two tubes called the bronchi until they reach small air sacks covered in blood vessels called alveoli. ""The lungs were long thought to be sterile, but we now know that oral commensals–microbes normally found in the mouth–frequently enter the lungs due to unconscious aspirations.” – Leopoldo Segal, Study Author and Director of the Lung Microbiome Program and Associate Professor of Medicine at New York University Grossman School of Medicine According to the study, after invading the lungs these microbes cause an inflammatory response in proteins known as cytokine IL-17. “Given the known impact of IL-17 and inflammation on lung cancer, we were interested in determining if the enrichment of oral commensals in the lungs could drive an IL-17-type inflammation and influence lung cancer progression and prognosis,” said Segal. While analyzing lung microbes of 83 untreated adults with lung cancer, the research team discovered that colonies of Veillonella, Prevotella, and Streptococcus bacteria, which may be cultivated through prolonged mask wearing, are all found in larger quantities in patients with advanced stage lung cancer than in earlier stages. The presence of these bacterial cultures is also associated with a lower chance of survival and increased tumor growth regardless of the stage. Additionally, research into the cultivation of Veillonella bacteria in the lungs of mice found that the presence of such bacteria leads to the emergence of immune suppressing cells as well as inflammatory ones such as cytokine IL-17. “Given the results of our study, it is possible that changes to the lung microbiome could be used as a biomarker to predict prognosis or to stratify patients for treatment.” – Leopoldo Segal As more evidence emerges pertaining to the long-term effects of mask mandates and lock downs, doctors and scientists are beginning to reconsider whether these authoritarian measures really are doing more harm than good. One Canadian public health expert named Dr. Aji Joffe found in a related study that lock downs cause “at least ten times” more damage than benefit. In a recent working paper by researchers at Harvard, Duke, and John Hopkins Universities, academics concluded that “for the overall population, the increase in the death rate following the COVID-19 pandemic implies a staggering 0.89 and 1.37 million excess deaths over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively.” Since forced mask wearing began, dermatologists have coined the term ‘maskne’ to describe an onset of pimples near the mouth caused by masks clogging up pores with oil and bacteria. This can be caused by either disposable or cloth masks. Dentists have also been warning about a phenomenon known as ‘mask mouth’ in which patients are arriving back to the dental office with an increase in gingivitis and tooth decay as high as 50% in a period of just a few months since mask mandates began. This discovery sheds light on the growing evidence of harm caused by long-term mask wearing","1 year ago A report by the Transparency International (TI) has said Ghana has been rated as the second most corrupt country in Africa, followed by Nigeria, with South Africa perceived as the most corrupt nation on the continent. The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) by the TI stated that about 71 per cent of people living in Ghana said corruption had increased over the last 12 months. The report revealed how people on the continent perceived their countries as far as corruption was concerned and what their leaders were doing to minimise that. It noted that corruption was so endemic that all the respondents wished their leaders acted swiftly to end the canker. Most governments across Africa were also seen as failing in their duty to stop the abuse of power, bribery and secret deals, according to the new opinion poll. The majority (58 per cent) of Africans in the surveyed countries said corruption had increased over the past 12 months. In 18 out of the 28 countries surveyed, a large majority of people said their governments were doing badly at fighting the canker. The report added that the police were regularly rated as highly corrupt, but the strong negative assessment of business executives was new, compared to previous surveys.",false

"A small team of Israeli scientists think they might have found the first complete cure for cancer. “We believe we will offer in a year’s time a complete cure for cancer,” said Dan Aridor, of a new treatment being developed by his company, Accelerated Evolution Biotechnologies Ltd. (AEBi), which was founded in 2000 in the ITEK incubator. AEBi developed the SoAP platform, which provides functional leads to very difficult targets. “Our cancer cure will be effective from day one, will last a duration of a few weeks and will have no or minimal side-effects at a much lower cost than most other treatments on the market,” Aridor said. “Our solution will be both generic and personal.” Dr. Ilan Moran (Courtesy)Dr. Ilan Moran (Courtesy) It sounds fantastical, especially considering that an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases are diagnosed worldwide each year, according to reports by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Further, every sixth death in the world is due to cancer, making it the second leading cause of death (second only to cardiovascular disease). Aridor, chairman of the board of AEBi and CEO Dr. Ilan Morad, say their treatment, which they call MuTaTo (multi-target toxin) is essentially on the scale of a cancer antibiotic – a disruption technology of the highest order. The potentially game-changing anti-cancer drug is based on SoAP technology, which belongs to the phage display group of technologies. It involves the introduction of DNA coding for a protein, such as an antibody, into a bacteriophage – a virus that infects bacteria. That protein is then displayed on the surface of the phage. Researchers can use these protein-displaying phages to screen for interactions with other proteins, DNA sequences and small molecules. In 2018, a team of scientists won the Nobel Prize for their work on phage display in the directed evolution of new proteins – in particular, for the production of antibody therapeutics. AEBi is doing something similar but with peptides, compounds of two or more amino acids linked in a chain. According to Morad, peptides have several advantages over antibodies, including that they are smaller, cheaper, and easier to produce and regulate. When the company first started, Morad said, “We were doing what everyone else was doing, trying to discover individual novel peptides for specific cancers.” But shortly thereafter, Morad and his colleague, Dr. Hanan Itzhaki, decided they wanted to do something bigger. To get started, Morad said they had to identify why other cancer-killing drugs and treatments don’t work or eventually fail. Then, they found a way to counter that effect. For starters, most anti-cancer drugs attack a specific target on or in the cancer cell, he explained. Inhibiting the target usually affects a physiological pathway that promotes cancer. Mutations in the targets – or downstream in their physiological pathways – could make the targets not relevant to the cancer nature of the cell, and hence the drug attacking it is rendered ineffective. In contrast, MuTaTo is using a combination of several cancer-targeting peptides for each cancer cell at the same time, combined with a strong peptide toxin that would kill cancer cells specifically. By using at least three targeting peptides on the same structure with a strong toxin, Morad said, “we made sure that the treatment will not be affected by mutations; cancer cells can mutate in such a way that targeted receptors are dropped by the cancer.” “The probability of having multiple mutations that would modify all targeted receptors simultaneously decreases dramatically with the number of targets used,” Morad continued. “Instead of attacking receptors one at a time, we attack receptors three at a time – not even cancer can mutate three receptors at the same time.” Furthermore, many cancer cells activate detoxification mechanisms when in stress from drugs. The cells pump out the drugs or modify them to be non-functional. But Morad said detoxification takes time. When the toxin is strong, it has a high probability of killing the cancer cell before detoxification occurs, which is what he is banking on. Many cytotoxic anticancer treatments aim at fast-growing cells. But cancer stem cells are not fast growing, and they can escape these treatments. Then, when the treatment is over, they can generate cancer again. “If it does not completely annihilate the cancer, the remaining cells can start to get mutations again, and then the cancer comes back, but this time it is drug resistant,” Morad said. He explained that because cancer cells are born out of mutations that occur in cancer stem cells, most of the overexpressed proteins which are targeted on the cancer cell exist in the cancer stem cells. MuTaTo’s multiple-target attack ensures that they will be destroyed as well. Finally, some cancer tumors erect shields which create access problems to large molecules, such as antibodies. MuTaTo acts like an octopus or a piece of spaghetti and can sneak into places where other large molecules cannot reach. Morad said the peptide parts of MuTaTo are very small (12 amino acids long) and lack a rigid structure. “This should make the whole molecule non-immunogenic in most cases and would enable repeated administration of the drug,” he said. Morad said their discovery could also reduce the sickening side-effects of most cancer treatments, which stem from drug treatments interacting with the wrong or additional targets, or the correct targets but on non-cancerous cells. He said MuTaTo’s having a combination of several highly specific cancer-targeting peptides on one scaffold for each type of cancer cell would increase the specificity to the cancer cell due to the avidity effect. In addition, in most cases, the non-cancer cells that have a protein in common with the cancer cells do not overexpress it. “This makes a great difference between the two kinds of cells and should decrease the side effects dramatically,” Morad said. He equated the concept of MuTaTo to the triple drug cocktail that has helped change AIDS from being an automatic death sentence to a chronic – but often manageable – disease. Today, AIDS patients take protease inhibitors in combination with two other drugs called reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The drug combination disrupts HIV at different stages in its replication, restrains an enzyme crucial to an early stage of HIV duplication and holds back another enzyme that functions near the end of the HIV replication process. “We used to give AIDS patients several drugs, but we would administer them one at a time,” Morad explained. “During the course of treatment, the virus mutated, and the AIDS started attacking again. Only when patients started using a cocktail, were they able to stop the disease.” Now, he said, people with AIDS are HIV carriers, but they are not sick anymore. The MuTaTo cancer treatment will eventually be personalized. Each patient will provide a piece of his biopsy to the lab, which would then analyze it to know which receptors are overexpressed. The individual would then be administered exactly the molecule cocktail needed to cure his disease. However, unlike in the case of AIDS, where patients must take the cocktail throughout their lives, in the case of MuTaTo, the cells would be killed, and the patient could likely stop treatment after only a few weeks. The company is now writing patents on specific peptides, which will be a large bank of targeting toxin peptides wholly owned and hard to break, said Aridor. Morad said that so far, the company has concluded its first exploratory mice experiment, which inhibited human cancer cell growth and had no effect at all on healthy mice cells, in addition to several in-vitro trials. AEBi is on the cusp of beginning a round of clinical trials which could be completed within a few years and would make the treatment available in specific cases.","CEDAR RAPIDS - A Cedar Rapids man who was arrested Monday is accused of holding a woman captive and forcing her to watch 'Roots” - a nine-hour miniseries that chronicles author Alex Haley's family line from the capture and enslavement of his ancestor Kunta Kinte to the liberation of Kinte's descendants.

"One of the strengths–and weaknesses–of a Western medical education is its predisposition to break things down and compartmentalize them. While much data is gleaned in the minutiae, very little attention is given to the interrelationship between disciplines. While a medical student may become a true specialist in their field, they too become compartmentalized, and are often ignorant of very important information that would be essential for a broader, more holistic overview. And this appears to be by design.  advertisement - learn more A case in point is the testimony of Tetyana Obukhanych, who earned her Ph.D. in Immunology at the Rockefeller University in New York and did post-graduate work at Harvard. In a presentation she delivered in British Columbia (full video here), she was discussing scientific evidence from a publication dealing with a measles outbreak in Quebec in 2011. The evidence showed that 48% of those who had contracted measles were fully vaccinated for measles, and this does not even include those who were vaccinated only once for the measles, as they get lumped in with the unvaccinated people. She took a moment to tell a story about how she became aware of this phenomenon: The interesting thing is that my field, the field of immunology, the basic field that sort of is responsible for all these theories of immunity, we don’t really deal with the real world. We do research in labs. We are sort of an ivory tower profession and we don’t even read these publications because this is too far away from our field. We only read what’s specific to our research and usually it’s immunizations and how antibodies are generated and all the details of the immune responses. And I went through my whole PhD training and I believed that vaccines give you immunity and that if you got vaccines there is absolutely no way, virtually no way, that you would get a disease, and I’m pretty sure that most of my colleagues in my narrow field believed the same way, and we had conversations about that. And even someone at some point mentioned to me and said that they had a vaccine and they got measles and I sort of brushed it aside and thought that the person is confused. It was either she didn’t have the vaccine or it wasn’t measles, one of the two. But what happen is that a few years ago I had to apply for American citizenship and part of the procedure is to submit your vaccination records, right, and this was the first time that I looked at my own vaccination records carefully, and I discovered that I had two measles vaccines in my childhood. Well, I didn’t know about it because I was too young to remember, but what I remember really well is that when I was 11 I had measles, and so that was a little bit harder to discount. And I told recently someone else and they said, ‘Oh, you are confused about that, you didn’t have measles!’ like ‘How do you know?’ ‘Did you check <whether> you really had the virus there or not?’ So it’s just, you know, the doctors diagnosis, right? But I lived in Ukraine, and there, you know, there was tons of measles around and doctors knew when they saw measles. But anyway, so the reason I kind of had to look for these papers is to actually to confirm to myself whether I’m confused about my measles or is this a general phenomenon and it’s happening, and it’s documented in the literature. And indeed it is documented in the literature. But immunologists don’t know about it. Let that sink in for a moment. You get your PhD in Immunology, and you leave school to go out into the world to work on things like, oh, immunization, and you haven’t learned that you can still get certain diseases even if you’ve been fully vaccinated against them? Despite this being scientifically documented and an uncontested fact? Again, ignorance by design.","Unvaccinated Children Pose No Risk To Anyone, Says Harvard Immunologist",false

Ex-ambassador McFaul switches to Russian to celebrate midterm victory over…Putin,"HOUSTON — In the weeks since President Obama’s re-election, Republicans around the country have been wondering how to proceed. Some conservatives in Texas have been asking a far more pointed question: how to secede. Secession fever has struck parts of Texas, which Mitt Romney won by nearly 1.3 million votes. Sales of bumper stickers reading “Secede” — one for $2, or three for $5 — have increased at TexasSecede.com. In East Texas, a Republican official sent out an e-mail newsletter saying it was time for Texas and Vermont to each “go her own way in peace” and sign a free-trade agreement among the states. A petition calling for secession that was filed by a Texas man on a White House Web site has received tens of thousands of signatures, and the Obama administration must now issue a response. And Larry Scott Kilgore, a perennial Republican candidate from Arlington, a Dallas suburb, announced that he was running for governor in 2014 and would legally change his name to Larry Secede Kilgore, with Secede in capital letters. As his Web page, secedekilgore.com, puts it: “Secession! All other issues can be dealt with later.” In Texas, talk of secession in recent years has steadily shifted to the center from the fringe right. It has emerged as an echo of the state Republican leadership’s anti-Washington, pro-Texas-sovereignty mantra on a variety of issues, including health care and environmental regulations. For some Texans, the renewed interest in the subject serves simply as comic relief after a crushing election defeat.",false

Coronavirus: One in four Northern Ireland adults ‘now at risk of hunger and malnutrition’,"HOUSTON, TX— Rep.

In response to a question by the Dallas Morning News, O’Rourke said: “…if I were asked to vote on this, I would vote to impeach the president.” O’Rourke explained that, “Impeachment, much like an indictment, shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed and at this point there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed.” O’Rourke has been consistent throughout his campaign for U.S. Senate that he would vote to impeach Pres. Trump, such as on KFYO radio on April 10, on Showtime’s “The Circus” in May — and as far back as an interview with Reuters in November 2017. “Rep. Beto O’Rourke is so radical and reckless that he is unfit to serve in the U.S. Senate,” said Sen.

White House Chef Quits Because Trump Has Only Eaten Fast Food For 6 Months,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said Thursday he does not believe carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming. ""I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""But we don't know that yet. ... We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis."" The statement contradicts the public stance of the agency Pruitt leads. The EPA's webpage on the causes of climate change states, ""Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change."" Pruitt's view is also at odds with the conclusion of NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere,"" NASA and NOAA said in January.

Weighing the Unknowns in Egypt - The New York Times,"As the world ponders the fate of Egypt after Hosni Mubarak, Americans should ponder this: It’s quite possible that if Mubarak had not ruled Egypt as a dictator for the last 30 years, the World Trade Center would still be standing. This is true even though Mubarak’s regime has been a steadfast U.S. ally, a partner in our counterterrorism efforts and a foe of Islamic radicalism. Or, more aptly, it’s true because his regime has been all of these things. In “The Looming Tower,” his history of Al Qaeda, Lawrence Wright raises the possibility that “America’s tragedy on September 11 was born in the prisons of Egypt.” By visiting imprisonment, torture and exile upon Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, Mubarak foreclosed any possibility of an Islamic revolution in his own country. But he also helped radicalize and internationalize his country’s Islamists, pushing men like Ayman Al-Zawahiri  Osama bin Laden’s chief lieutenant, and arguably the real brains behind Al Qaeda  out of Egyptian politics and into the global jihad. At the same time, Mubarak’s relationship with Washington has offered constant vindication for the jihadi worldview. Under his rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel. For many young Egyptians, restless amid political and economic stagnation, it’s been a short leap from hating their dictator to hating his patrons in the United States. One of the men who made this leap was an architecture student named Mohamed Atta, who was at the cockpit when American Airlines Flight 11 hit the World Trade Center.",true

"Belgian government Minister Fremault announced that Brussels is halting their 5G plans due to the negative health effects. Celine Fremault, Minister of the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region Responsible For Housing, Quality Of Life, Environment And Energy released the statement in an interview with L’Echo: “I cannot welcome such technology if the radiation standards, which must protect the citizen, are not respected, 5G or not. The people of Brussels are not guinea pigs whose health I can sell at a profit. We cannot leave anything to doubt."" Minister Fremault accurately identified that the 5G pilot project will not be compatible with Belgian radiation safety standards of 9 V/m, or 95 mW/m2, and has stated that she will not be making an exception. In the guidelines the threshold for extreme concern is 1 mW/m2, however many government agencies still only consider thermal effects and profit rather than the cumulative body of the thousands of peer reviewed scientific studies. With Brussels heading up the EU, and with one of the 2 major 5G appeals being addressed to the EU officials officials they seem to be better informed and motivated to protect themselves in the EU. Hopefully support continues to build for Minister Celine Fremault and all officials who are hearing the call to sanity and plea of the people to prioritize their safety over the technocratic oligarchy. Perhaps officials in North America and elsewhere should take note and follow suit, after all that motivating profit will soon stop once more people get sick and can no longer spend money. Should anyone care to send a brief note of support to Minister Celine Fremault please go to: https://be.brussels/about-the-region/the-government-of-the-region/fremault ; Brussel city councilors: https://www.brussels.be/city-councillors Please help to encourage them of the importance to make and keep this ban permanent despite the mistruths being told regarding the untested safety and forthcoming pressure from the self serving communications industry.

This alone should be enough to delete the granting of the unheard of powers to the greedy soulless corporate algorithms, this entire situation should be filed under an attempt of useful technology gone bad for profit and control. The question that should be really be asked by everyone is does 5G pose a threat to all biological life? It hasn’t been fully tested, and the results of independent evidence is overwhelmingly suggesting that yes 5G dose pose a major threat. That is unless you ask the telecommunications networks and the agencies and officials within their deep pockets who release untruths, withhold information, and attempt to quash pushback. In a US senate hearing the wireless industry even brashly admitted they have not done any safety studies and don’t plan to. Hundreds of scientists are trying to sound the alarm and raise the red flags. Dr. Martin Pall has conducted research that has laid out the mechanisms of how wireless radiation causes harm in our cells, and calls 5G “the stupidest idea in the history of the world.” Unfortunately those deep pockets of the telecommunications giants run deep and wide, within corporatized halls of government full of lobbyists that drown out the voice of reason with dreams of grandeur, control and greed for the unprecedented economic opportunities of the full on commercial exploitation of reality for even more profit and deprivation among these agenda pushers stuck in hive mind states blinded by the control and dollar signs obsessions, who are at the very least incapable of seeing where all this is heading and what will happen to them, their families, and all life on Earth. All of the industry and its sheepeople are being presented with scientific evidence of this catastrophe in the making, and being asked to wait for testing before forcing 5G upon the world. Yet they are refusing to listen and continue towing their control and profit pushing line. Why is this being allowed, how can it be ignored unless they have a dark agenda that includes a shadow of expression for an utter disdain for life. Perhaps even at the core of this desire lays an agenda to exit the human condition via AI and transhumanism seeking escape through technology rather than humanity and connection with divinity. Why else would this be pushed for so hard, untested, at all costs, ignoring the plea of science, it does make one wonder. To any sane person with normal values this 5G situation is to say the least bewildering and alarming. Perhaps with current connectedness we can help other become aware and work together to find a solution and choice for a positive future and push back against 5G. Brussels is the first major international to block 5G, dozens of others have passed legislation to prevent or restrict 5G rollouts due to health effects.

While the warming could be the result of natural climate change alone, the researchers said, it is likely that the effects of human-caused warming contributed to it. The pole, home to a United States research base in the high, icy emptiness of the Antarctic interior, warmed by about 0.6 degrees Celsius, or 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade over the past 30 years, the researchers reported in a paper published in Nature Climate Change. The global average over that time was about 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. Although parts of coastal Antarctica are losing ice, which contributes to sea level rise, the pole is in no danger of melting, as the year-round average temperature is still about minus-50 degrees Celsius. But the finding shows that no place is unaffected by change on a warming planet.",true
Is Meghan Markle already preparing a bid to be America's first woman President?,"Of all the major Republicans, the one who comes closest to my worldview is Newt Gingrich. Despite his erratically shifting views and odd phases, he continually returns to this core political refrain: He talks about using government in energetic but limited ways to increase growth, dynamism and social mobility. As he said in 2007, “It’s not a point of view libertarians would embrace, but I am more in the Alexander Hamilton-Teddy Roosevelt tradition of conservatism. I recognize that there are times when you need government to help spur private enterprise and economic development.” Look at American history, Gingrich continued, “The government provided railroad land grants to encourage widespread adoption of what was then the most modern form of transportation to develop our country. The Homestead Act essentially gave away land to those willing to live on it and develop it. We used what were in effect public-private partnerships to bring telephone service and electricity to every community in our nation. All of these are examples of government bringing about public purposes without creating massive taxpayer-funded bureaucracies.” This was not one of Gingrich’s passing fads. It is one of the most consistent themes of his career. His 1984 book, “Window of Opportunity,” is a broadside against what he calls the “laissez-faire” conservatism — the idea that government should just get out of the way so the market can flourish. As he wrote, “The opportunity society calls not for a laissez-faire society in which the economic world is a neutral jungle of purely random individual behavior, but for forceful government intervention on behalf of growth and opportunity.”",true

"At least 13 Israelis have experienced facial paralysis after being administered the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, a month after the US Food and Drug Administration reported similar issues but said they weren’t linked to the jab. Israel has been hailed for its speedy and efficient mass inoculation program, which has vaccinated a staggering 20 percent of the country’s population since the drive began at the end of December. For a handful of Israelis, however, the initiative has led to some unexpected health scares. At least 13 people have reported mild facial paralysis after receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, Israeli outlet Ynet reported, citing the Health Ministry, adding that officials believe the number of such cases could be higher. “For at least 28 hours I walked around with it [facial paralysis],” one person who had the side effect told Ynet. “I can't say it was completely gone afterwards, but other than that I had no other pains, except a minor pain where the injection was, but there was nothing beyond that.”  The unnamed individual noted, though, that the unpleasant reaction was “something rare” and stressed that it was “important” people get vaccinated. However, he conceded that he was undecided about receiving a second dose of the vaccine. Israel’s Health Ministry has stated that it is safe to administer the second shot, provided the facial paralysis passes and there are no lingering, long-term effects from the first jab. But some Israeli medical experts have chosen to ignore this advisory. Ynet quoted Prof. Galia Rahav, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba Medical Center, who said she did not feel “comfortable” with administering the second dose to someone who had received the first jab and subsequently suffered from paralysis. “No one knows if this is connected to the vaccine or not. That's why I would refrain from giving a second dose to someone who suffered from paralysis after the first dose,” she told the outlet. Last month the FDA disclosed that Bell’s palsy, a form of temporary facial paralysis, was reported by four participants during phase three trials of the Pfizer vaccine. All four cases involved individuals who had been given the actual jab. There were no reports of paralysis among the control group that received a placebo. In its report, the FDA noted the “numerical imbalance” of Bell’s palsy cases among the vaccine and placebo groups, but it said there were no other “non-serious adverse events” that showed a similar pattern. Ultimately, the US drug regulator concluded that the issue was “consistent with the expected background rate in the general population,” and added that there was no clear evidence linking the coronavirus vaccine to the unpleasant medical condition. Still, the agency recommended“surveillance for cases of Bell’s palsy with deployment of the vaccine into larger populations.” Over the past several weeks, the Pfizer drug has received emergency approval from governments scrambling to vaccinate their citizens. In December, the UK became the first country in the world to begin administering the jab to the general population. Although health officials have described the vaccine as safe and effective at reducing Covid-19 symptoms, worrying reports continue to surface about serious adverse effects. Mexico launched a probe in early January after a young doctor was left paralyzed minutes after being administered the drug. There have also been numerous cases in which people who suffer from allergies have experienced severe reactions to the shot. Several reports have also linked the jab to unexplained deaths, but authorities have insisted that there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine is to blame in such cases. For example, a Portugese doctor who was reportedly in “perfect health”died shortly after being given the jab, but officials later concluded that there was no relationship between the death and the vaccine, adding that they could not disclose the exact cause of her death for legal reasons.","As a subscriber, you are shown 80% less display advertising when reading our articles.

"A quote from Politifact: Gates never said that the first licensed COVID-19 vaccine would use experimental technology or permanently alter DNA; he said specifically that “we don’t know yet what the COVID-19 vaccine will look like.” The most recent research also shows that RNA vaccines, which are being tested for COVID-19 right now, do degrade naturally and don’t alter DNA permanently. It does appear that there is some contention over the potential that DNA vaccines may permanently change a person’s DNA, as highlighted in this white paper from biotech company Moderna, a leading developer of RNA vaccine technology: “DNA vaccine work began thirty years ago, but as yet there are no licensed DNA vaccines and most remain in Phase 1 testing. (Figure 5) The key challenge associated with DNA vaccines is that they must penetrate the cell nucleus (crossing two membranes; the cytoplasm and the nucleus). The DNA must then be transcribed in the nucleus into mRNA before moving to the cytoplasm to stimulate antigen production. This core complex pathway often requires both larger doses and special, often painful delivery devices using electric shocks or gold microspheres into person’s skin to deliver the DNA vaccine. Once inside the nucleus, DNA vaccines have a risk of permanently changing a person’s DNA. ” [Source] Given the current state of world affairs, we felt that providing this correction and explanation was the best way to bring clarity and another perspective to this important issue. For any comments or questions, please contact editor@wakingtimes.com. —- “Currently, there are no RNA vaccines approved for human use.” ~Wikipedia Rather than instruct people on how to improve their overall health or boost their immunity with healthy foods, quality supplements, and physical activity, the powers-that-be are telling the world that the only way to survive the Coronavirus crisis is to rush the development of a vaccine and then inject every human being on the planet. The U.S. government along with major cities like Chicago are already moving forward with plans to use government resources and the military to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines to Americans by the end of the year. At the forefront of this conversation is Bill Gates, who has emerged somehow as the world’s leading expert on pandemics and vaccines. Through his foundation he supports the WHO and the development of new vaccines, and is currently backing a number of pharmaceutical companies as they race to invent the product that will save the world from Covid-19. Typically, the process of developing, testing and mass producing vaccines takes years, but thanks to newly emerging, experimental technology, Gates hopes to be able to vaccine “7 billion healthy people” in record time. A new generation of vaccines is emerging as we speak. At present there are no DNA and RNA vaccines approved for human use, but as Gates says in the following post from his personal blog, the time for trying these out on everyone has come. In the following comment he explains the difference between traditional vaccines and DNA/RNA vaccines, which, again, have never been approved for human use: “Vaccines circumvent this whole process by teaching your body how to defeat a pathogen without ever getting sick. The two most common types—and the ones you’re probably most familiar with—are inactivated and live vaccines. Inactivated vaccines contain pathogens that have been killed. Live vaccines, on the other hand, are made of living pathogens that have been weakened (or “attenuated”). They’re highly effective but more prone to side effects than their inactivated counterparts. Inactivated and live vaccines are what we consider “traditional” approaches. There are a number of COVID-19 vaccine candidates of both types, and for good reason: they’re well-established. We know how to test and manufacture them. The downside is that they’re time-consuming to make. There’s a ton of material in each dose of a vaccine. Most of that material is biological, which means you have to grow it. That takes time, unfortunately. That’s why I’m particularly excited by two new approaches that some of the candidates are taking: RNA and DNA vaccines. If one of these new approaches pans out, we’ll likely be able to get vaccines out to the whole world much faster. (For the sake of simplicity, I’m only going to explain RNA vaccines. DNA vaccines are similar, just with a different type of genetic material and method of administration.) Our foundation—both through our own funding and through CEPI—has been supporting the development of an RNA vaccine platform for nearly a decade. We were planning to use it to make vaccines for diseases that affect the poor like malaria, but now it’s looking like one of the most promising options for COVID. The first candidate to start human trials was an RNA vaccine created by a company called Moderna. Here’s how an RNA vaccine works: rather than injecting a pathogen’s antigen into your body, you instead give the body the genetic code needed to produce that antigen itself. When the antigens appear on the outside of your cells, your immune system attacks them—and learns how to defeat future intruders in the process. You essentially turn your body into its own vaccine manufacturing unit. Here’s how an RNA vaccine works: rather than injecting a pathogen’s antigen into your body, you instead give the body the genetic code needed to produce that antigen itself. When the antigens appear on the outside of your cells, your immune system attacks them—and learns how to defeat future intruders in the process. You essentially turn your body into its own vaccine manufacturing unit. Because RNA vaccines let your body do most of the work, they don’t require much material. That makes them much faster to manufacture. There’s a catch, though: we don’t know for sure yet if RNA is a viable platform for vaccines. Since COVID would be the first RNA vaccine out of the gate, we have to prove both that the platform itself works and that it creates immunity. It’s a bit like building your computer system and your first piece of software at the same time.” ~ Bill Gates So, the rushed Covid-19 vaccine will most likely not be a traditional vaccine. It will not be tested for the typical duration that most vaccines are tested for. It will very likely be distributed by the military, and it everyone on the planet will have to take it.",BILL GATES EXPLAINS THAT THE COVID VACCINE WILL LIKELY USE EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGY,false

"No, the coronavirus is not the leading cause of death in the US, CDC says","(CNN) Even though the coronavirus pandemic continues to take lives across the United States, Covid-19 has not become the leading cause of death in the nation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed to CNN. ""There are no data to support that theory,"" Jeff Lancashire, a spokesperson for the National Center for Health Statistics, said in an email on Friday. False claims declaring that coronavirus has become the leading cause of death in the US have swirled as the US leads the world in coronavirus cases . Those claims are made by some experts comparing how many people die of coronavirus daily with the estimate of how many people may die daily on average of each leading cause of death, using CDC data. In other words -- the claims involve comparing reported deaths from Covid-19 to estimated deaths for leading causes of deaths, which include heart disease and cancer. Read More",true
"Parents concerned about their vaccinated children potentially contracting measles from unvaccinated children may want to consider the fact that the bigger health threat is technically the vaccine, not the disease itself. Comparative data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reveal that nobody has died from measles in more than 10 years, while at least 108 deaths reported in VAERS during the same time frame have been linked to measles vaccines. Many of our older readers probably remember a time when measles wasn't viewed with the obscene level of paranoid hysterics being witnessed today. Like chickenpox, measles was a common childhood infection that, after running its typically mild course, imparted lifelong immunity in those who contracted it. The risk of serious complications or death from measles has always been overwhelmingly minimal, in other words, with previous generations viewing it as something of a rite of passage. Fast forward to today and all rationality and common sense has gone out the window on this issue. The media is reporting a few isolated cases of measles as if it were the black plague, calling for those who don't vaccinate their children to be ostracized from their communities or even jailed for ""putting others at unnecessary risk."" But where are the facts in all this unsubstantiated mania, which unfairly tags the unvaccinated as dangerous lepers? Once again, the media is discarding factual reporting in favor of mindless sensationalism, attributing an alleged measles resurgence -- even this claim is specious -- to the unvaccinated. Whether or not this claim is actually true pales in importance compared to the fact that measles really isn't much of a threat in the first place. The measles vaccine, on the other hand, is a whole different story. ""There have been no measles deaths reported in the U.S. since 2003,"" the Associate Press reported based off statements made by Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Meanwhile, VAERS, which captures only a very small percentage of the actual number of injuries and deaths associated with measles vaccines, reports at least 108 deaths associated with measles vaccines since 2003. Of these, a shocking 96 deaths were reported in conjunction with MMR, which is now the preferred vaccine for measles immunization. Measles deaths were virtually nonexistent prior to introduction of vaccine, which is now triggering outbreaks Some will try to argue that measles deaths are essentially nonexistent now because of measles vaccines, the first of which was introduced in 1963. But this argument holds no water -- U.S. measles mortality data shows that deaths from measles rapidly declined in the years leading up to when the first vaccine was introduced, validating the success of improved sanitation and better nutrition in making measles a non-problem. ""What you may not have heard, is that by 1963, the death rate from measles in the United States had already dropped by approximately 98%,"" explains the International Medical Council on Vaccination (IMCV). Not long after it was introduced, the first measles vaccine was actually found to manifest worse symptoms of measles in vaccinated patients than if they hadn't gotten the vaccine at all. The vaccine also suppressed the normal rash and fever associated with measles, obstructing the normal immune response and ultimately leading to future health problems for vaccinated individuals once they reached adulthood. ""[W]hereas natural measles exposure generally left the person with reliable lifelong immunity, measles vaccines leave the individual with waning immunity,"" adds IMCV. ""This dynamic of waning immunity means we will probably see measles epidemics even in highly vaccinated populations.""","ADVERTISEMENT Despite the closure of all tertiary institutions by the federal government, the Academic Staff of Universities Union (ASUU) has declared an indefinite strike after the expiration of its two-weeks warning strike. The national president of the union, Biodun Ogunyemi, announced the strike at a press conference in Abuja on Monday. “The union has decided to embark on total and indefinite strike from Monday 23,2020, ” he said. He said the union rejects the use of force to enrol on Integrated Payroll and Personal Information System (IPPIS). The National Universities Commission ordered universities across the country to close for a month, beginning from March 23, due to the outbreak of coronavirus. The union commenced its warning strike on March 9, 2020. Since the commencement of the strike, the government met with the union twice. ASUU is embarking on the strike over the non-payment of salaries of their members who failed to enrol into the federal government’s IPPIS, a payroll software mandated for all public officials. The government, last Thursday, also reached an interim agreement with striking university lecturers to integrate the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) into the IPPIS. The IPPIS is the government’s accountability software that has been made compulsory for all public institutions, mainly for personnel payroll. ASUU is opposed to the use of IPPIS for lecturers, saying it does not consider some of the peculiar operations of universities. The lecturers’ union then developed its own UTAS which it wants the government to adopt for universities. More details later…",true

Capitol Shooting Exposed as Hollywood Stunt,"Beaumont, Texas | An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers. According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight. While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year-old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory. Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes. Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson’s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated. “At first, we didn’t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.” Ms. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body. The police have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Johnson’s death. Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of filing criminal charges against the employee who caused his death. The young man could possibly be accused of criminal negligence causing death.",false

Ex-ambassador McFaul switches to Russian to celebrate midterm victory over…Putin,"HOUSTON — In the weeks since President Obama’s re-election, Republicans around the country have been wondering how to proceed. Some conservatives in Texas have been asking a far more pointed question: how to secede. Secession fever has struck parts of Texas, which Mitt Romney won by nearly 1.3 million votes. Sales of bumper stickers reading “Secede” — one for $2, or three for $5 — have increased at TexasSecede.com. In East Texas, a Republican official sent out an e-mail newsletter saying it was time for Texas and Vermont to each “go her own way in peace” and sign a free-trade agreement among the states. A petition calling for secession that was filed by a Texas man on a White House Web site has received tens of thousands of signatures, and the Obama administration must now issue a response. And Larry Scott Kilgore, a perennial Republican candidate from Arlington, a Dallas suburb, announced that he was running for governor in 2014 and would legally change his name to Larry Secede Kilgore, with Secede in capital letters. As his Web page, secedekilgore.com, puts it: “Secession! All other issues can be dealt with later.” In Texas, talk of secession in recent years has steadily shifted to the center from the fringe right. It has emerged as an echo of the state Republican leadership’s anti-Washington, pro-Texas-sovereignty mantra on a variety of issues, including health care and environmental regulations. For some Texans, the renewed interest in the subject serves simply as comic relief after a crushing election defeat.",false

"One of the strengths–and weaknesses–of a Western medical education is its predisposition to break things down and compartmentalize them. While much data is gleaned in the minutiae, very little attention is given to the interrelationship between disciplines. While a medical student may become a true specialist in their field, they too become compartmentalized, and are often ignorant of very important information that would be essential for a broader, more holistic overview. And this appears to be by design.  advertisement - learn more A case in point is the testimony of Tetyana Obukhanych, who earned her Ph.D. in Immunology at the Rockefeller University in New York and did post-graduate work at Harvard. In a presentation she delivered in British Columbia (full video here), she was discussing scientific evidence from a publication dealing with a measles outbreak in Quebec in 2011. The evidence showed that 48% of those who had contracted measles were fully vaccinated for measles, and this does not even include those who were vaccinated only once for the measles, as they get lumped in with the unvaccinated people. She took a moment to tell a story about how she became aware of this phenomenon: The interesting thing is that my field, the field of immunology, the basic field that sort of is responsible for all these theories of immunity, we don’t really deal with the real world. We do research in labs. We are sort of an ivory tower profession and we don’t even read these publications because this is too far away from our field. We only read what’s specific to our research and usually it’s immunizations and how antibodies are generated and all the details of the immune responses. And I went through my whole PhD training and I believed that vaccines give you immunity and that if you got vaccines there is absolutely no way, virtually no way, that you would get a disease, and I’m pretty sure that most of my colleagues in my narrow field believed the same way, and we had conversations about that. And even someone at some point mentioned to me and said that they had a vaccine and they got measles and I sort of brushed it aside and thought that the person is confused. It was either she didn’t have the vaccine or it wasn’t measles, one of the two. But what happen is that a few years ago I had to apply for American citizenship and part of the procedure is to submit your vaccination records, right, and this was the first time that I looked at my own vaccination records carefully, and I discovered that I had two measles vaccines in my childhood. Well, I didn’t know about it because I was too young to remember, but what I remember really well is that when I was 11 I had measles, and so that was a little bit harder to discount. And I told recently someone else and they said, ‘Oh, you are confused about that, you didn’t have measles!’ like ‘How do you know?’ ‘Did you check <whether> you really had the virus there or not?’ So it’s just, you know, the doctors diagnosis, right? But I lived in Ukraine, and there, you know, there was tons of measles around and doctors knew when they saw measles. But anyway, so the reason I kind of had to look for these papers is to actually to confirm to myself whether I’m confused about my measles or is this a general phenomenon and it’s happening, and it’s documented in the literature. And indeed it is documented in the literature. But immunologists don’t know about it. Let that sink in for a moment. You get your PhD in Immunology, and you leave school to go out into the world to work on things like, oh, immunization, and you haven’t learned that you can still get certain diseases even if you’ve been fully vaccinated against them? Despite this being scientifically documented and an uncontested fact? Again, ignorance by design.","Unvaccinated Children Pose No Risk To Anyone, Says Harvard Immunologist",false

Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  Any abusive behaviour “targeted towards a woman by a man” could be outlawed.  But the proposals are so far ranging that lads could be dragged before courts and face serious sentences if they whistle at a woman and she calls police.  Workers who “objectify and harass” women in the streets face being cuffed and prosecuted, campaigners have warned.  New rules would make “behaviour towards a woman by men simply because they are a woman” equal to crimes where victims are attacked for their race, religion or sexual orientation.  Image: GETTY  A wolf-whistle would be unlikely to constitute a public order offence, but would be looked at more seriously if it formed a pattern of behaviour.  Incidents that could be looked at by police include harassment in the street, verbal abuse, unwanted physical approaches, taking photographs without consent or sending unwanted text messages.  Trialled by Notts Police, campaigners are now calling for the rules to go nationwide. An open letter signed by several groups and faith leaders has demanded the National Police Chiefs Council make misogyny – or woman-hating – a crime.  But a study by the University of Nottingham said rank and file police officers considered the policy a “tick box” exercise which ate up time and resources.",false
British youngsters 'most illiterate' in developed world,"British youngsters are the most illiterate in the developed world, according to the findings of a new report that ranks worldwide numeracy and literacy levels.  According to the organisation for economic co-operation and development, who analysed data from around the world, English teenagers aged 16 to 19 were judged to have the worst literacy levels and the second to worst numeracy levels of the 23 developed nations that were compared.  The report also suggested there were millions of adults between 16-65 in England who struggle with basic quantitative reasoning or have difficulty with simple written information.  There are an estimated nine million working aged adults in England more than a quarter of adults aged 16-65 with low literacy or numeracy skills or both. OECD  The OECD's Credit: OECD  Key findings from the report:  England has three times more low-skilled people among those aged 16-19 than the best-performing countries like Finland and Japan  Around one in ten of all university students in England have numeracy or literacy levels below level 2  English 15 year-olds have similar literacy levels to their counterparts but by 20-22 their literacyskills appear to fall behind  What the OECD recommends should be done about the issue?

Only by leaving EU will we escape human rights legislation,"By Edward Spalton. This article irst appeared in the Derby Evening Telegraph on 10th October  Mr Cameron is, of course, quite right that the European Convention on Human Rights ECHR has been expanded to a parody of its original laudable intentions.  It once took many thousands of pounds from public funds to pay a lawyer, Cherie Blair, to take a case on behalf of a schoolgirl who did not want to wear her school uniform.  As long as he keeps us in the EU, Mr Cameron cannot get us out of obeying the ECHR.  In 2011, the EU Commission a separate body wrote: “Respect for fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights is an explicit obligation for the Union under article 6 3 of the Treaty on European Union… i.e., the Lisbon Treaty. …. The Court of Justice of the EU has held that the Convention is of special importance for determining the fundamental rights that must be respected by the member states.”  So, if Mr Cameron does run away from the European Court of Human Rights, the EU’s own Court of Justice will drag him back and compel his obedience to it. That is in the Lisbon Treaty, which is our country’s supreme constitution, overriding the Magna Carta, Queen, Lords and Commons as long as we remain in the EU. It is the same treaty on which “Cast Iron Cameron” promised us a referendum.",true
A&E admissions for alcohol poisoning double with teen girls most at risk,"Admissions to A&E for alcohol poisoning has doubled in five years and figures show that teen girls are more at risk from binge drinking.  The number of teenage girls aged 15-19 going to A&E with suspected alcohol poisoning in 2013/14 was nearly 38% higher than boys in the same age range, according to a study by the Nuffield Trust.  Overall, there was a 104% increase in A&E attendance rates last year from 2008/9, the study showed.  ITV News' Rebecca Barry reports:  In all other age categories, A&E attendances relating to alcohol were higher among men.

How to Close Great Britain’s Great Divide: The business of tackling inequality,"Overview  Today in Britain there is a massive disconnect between people and politicians, and between the ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’. The richest one percent of the UK population own more than 20 times more wealth than the poorest 20 percent combined.  The EU referendum vote was a stark illustration of just how polarized our society is, with millions of voters expressing their frustration at being locked out of politics and economic opportunity. It is encouraging then that Prime Minister Theresa May has committed to creating a society that works for everyone, not just the fortunate few.  Oxfam welcomes this commitment and believes that addressing inequality, particularly by considering the role of businesses, can help bring the country together and ensure that everyone has a fair share in the economy.

Major Climate Report Describes a Strong Risk of Crisis as Early as 2040,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.  INCHEON, South Korea — A landmark report from the United Nations’ scientific panel on climate change paints a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought and says that avoiding the damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has “no documented historic precedent.”  The report, issued on Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists convened by the United Nations to guide world leaders, describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040 — a period well within the lifetime of much of the global population.  The report “is quite a shock, and quite concerning,” said Bill Hare, an author of previous I.P.C.C. reports and a physicist with Climate Analytics, a nonprofit organization. “We were not aware of this just a few years ago.” The report was the first to be commissioned by world leaders under the Paris agreement, the 2015 pact by nations to fight global warming.  The authors found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the atmosphere will warm up by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels by 2040, inundating coastlines and intensifying droughts and poverty. Previous work had focused on estimating the damage if average temperatures were to rise by a larger number, 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius), because that was the threshold scientists previously considered for the most severe effects of climate change.",true
Earth Sets a Temperature Record for the Third Straight Year,"El Niño has now ended, and climate scientists almost universally expect 2017 to be cooler than the year before. But the scale of the heat burst has been startling to many of the experts, and some of them fear an accelerated era of global warming could be at hand over the next few years.  Even at current temperatures, billions of tons of land ice are melting or sliding into the ocean. The sea is also absorbing most of the heat trapped by human emissions. Those factors are causing the ocean to rise at what appears to be an accelerating pace, and coastal communities in the United States are beginning to spend billions to fight increased tidal flooding. Their pleas for help from Congress have largely been ignored.  The finding that a record had been set for the third year in a row was released on Wednesday by three government agencies, two of them American and one British, that track measurements made by ships, buoys and land-based weather stations. They analyze the figures to correct for known problems, producing an annual average temperature for the surface of the Earth. The national meteorological agency of Japan confirmed the findings in a preliminary analysis.  In the British data set, 2016 set a record by only a small amount; the margin was larger in the NOAA data set and larger still in NASA’s. NASA does more work than the other groups to take full account of Arctic temperatures, and several scientists said they believed the NASA record to be the most accurate for 2016 for that reason.",true
Sea ice in Arctic and Antarctic at record lows,"Story highlights It's a key indicator of climate change and can mean changes to weather  Temperatures are 30 degrees above normal at the North Pole  (CNN) For what appears to be the first time since scientists began keeping track, sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic are at record lows this time of year.  ""It looks like, since the beginning of October, that for the first time we are seeing both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice running at record low levels,"" said Walt Meier, a research scientist with the Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who has tracked sea ice data going back to 1979.  While record low sea ice is nothing new in the Arctic, this is a surprising turn of events for the Antarctic. Even as sea ice in the Arctic has seen a rapid and consistent decline over the past decade, its counterpart in the Southern Hemisphere has seen its extent increasing.  In fact, each year from 2012 through 2014 reached a record high for Antarctic sea ice extent. Skeptics have long pointed to ice gain in the Southern Hemisphere as evidence climate change wasn't occurring, but scientists warned that it was caused by natural variations and circulations in the atmosphere.  While it is too early to know if the recent, rapid decline in Antarctic sea ice is going to be a regular occurrence like in the Arctic, it ""certainly puts the kibosh on everyone saying that Antarctica's ice is just going up and up,"" Meier said.

Seas Are Rising at Fastest Rate in Last 28 Centuries,"Though these types of floods often produce only a foot or two of standing saltwater, they are straining life in many towns by killing lawns and trees, blocking neighborhood streets and clogging storm drains, polluting supplies of freshwater and sometimes stranding entire island communities for hours by overtopping the roads that tie them to the mainland.  Such events are just an early harbinger of the coming damage, the new research suggests.  “I think we need a new way to think about most coastal flooding,” said Benjamin H. Strauss, the primary author of one of two related studies released on Monday. “It’s not the tide. It’s not the wind. It’s us. That’s true for most of the coastal floods we now experience.”  In the second study, scientists reconstructed the level of the sea over time and confirmed that it is most likely rising faster than at any point in 28 centuries, with the rate of increase growing sharply over the past century — largely, they found, because of the warming that scientists have said is almost certainly caused by human emissions.  They also confirmed previous forecasts that if emissions were to continue at a high rate over the next few decades, the ocean could rise as much as three or four feet by 2100.  Experts say the situation would then grow far worse in the 22nd century and beyond, likely requiring the abandonment of many coastal cities.",true
"Observations show sea levels rising, and climate change is accelerating it","Story highlights Global sea level is on the rise at an increasing rate, according to a new study  By the end of the century, it could rise another 2 feet  (CNN) Sea level rise is happening now, and the rate at which it is rising is increasing every year, according to a study released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Researchers, led by University of Colorado-Boulder professor of aerospace engineering sciences Steve Nerem, used satellite data dating to 1993 to observe the levels of the world's oceans.  Changes in sea level observed between 1992 and 2014. Orange/red colors represent higher sea levels, while blue colors show where sea levels are lower.  Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.  The team observed a total rise in the ocean of 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) in 25 years of data, which aligns with the generally accepted current rate of sea level rise of about 3 millimeters (0.1 inches) per year.  But that rate is not constant.  Read More",true
Arctic’s Winter Sea Ice Drops to Its Lowest Recorded Level,"After a season that saw temperatures soar at the North Pole, the Arctic has less sea ice at winter’s end than ever before in nearly four decades of satellite measurements.  The extent of ice cover — a record low for the third straight year — is another indicator of the effects of global warming on the Arctic, a region that is among the hardest hit by climate change, scientists said.  “This is just another exclamation point on the overall loss of Arctic sea ice coverage that we’ve been seeing,” said Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, a government-backed research agency in Boulder, Colo. “We’re heading for summers with no sea ice coverage at all.”  Dr. Serreze said that such a situation, which would leave nothing but open ocean in summer until fall freeze-up begins, could occur by 2030, although many scientists say it may not happen for a decade or two after that.",true

Macdonald was taken off of the Weekend Update desk in 1998 at the behest of Don Ohlmeyer, president of NBC's West Coast division, allegedly because of ratings, although Macdonald believed that it was actually because he was ""insubordinate,"" especially when it came to jokes at the expense of people like of Michael Jackson and OJ Simpson. Macdonald ended up leaving the program later that season altogether.  During and after his time at SNL, Macdonald starred in several films and TV shows, including Dirty Work, Screwed, Billy Madison, The Norm Show, A Minute With Stan Hooper, The Middle, and more. He also had a career as a voice over artist for the Dr. Dolittle series as Lucky the dog, and in several TV series including Family Guy, Mike Tyson Mysteries, and more.  But he developed his reputation as a comic's comic in several stand-up specials, as well as his frequent appearances on various podcasts (including his own, Norm Macdonald Live) and late night shows, especially Late Show with David Letterman, The Howard Stern Show and Conan. He also appeared occasionally at various celebrity roasts, most famously delivering a hilarious roast of Bob Saget that is still remembered as one of the greatest roasts of the modern era.",true

Bill Clinton Dead at GITMO,"Former President William Jefferson Clinton, whom on July 24 the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps sentenced to life in prison at Guantanamo Bay, was found dead in his cell early Saturday morning.  Sources at the nation’s most infamous detention center told RRN that GITMO security discovered Clinton’s lifeless body at approximately 7:00 a.m., when they were delivering breakfast trays to segregated prisoners.  “He was face down on the floor in a pool of what appeared to be his own vomit,” a GITMO source told RRN. “Security called out to him several times, and when he didn’t respond, guards and a medical technician entered the cell to check his vitals. He had no pulse and was declared deceased.”  Clinton was alive the night earlier at head check and lights out, our source added.  “He ate his 6:00 p.m. meal and was alive on his bunk at 9:00 p.m.,” our source said. “Bill Clinton is in a segregated area and no other GITMO inmates have access to his cell.

Sweden stops PCR tests as Covid-19 Diagnosis,"8 May 2021 — Tap News  Legal precedent set. The Swedish Public Health Agency has developed national criteria for assessing freedom from infection in covid-19.  The Swedish Public Health Agency has developed national criteria for assessing freedom from infection in covid-19.  The PCR technology used in tests to detect viruses cannot distinguish between viruses capable of infecting cells and viruses that have been neutralized by the immune system and therefore these tests cannot be used to determine whether someone is contagious or not. RNA from viruses can often be detected for weeks (sometimes months) after the illness but does not mean that you are still contagious. There are also several scientific studies that suggest that the infectivity of covid-19 is greatest at the beginning of the disease period.  The recommended criteria for assessing freedom from infection are therefore based on stable clinical improvement with freedom from fever for at least two days and that at least seven days have passed since the onset of symptoms. For those who have had more pronounced symptoms, at least 14 days after the illness and for the very sickest, individual assessment by the treating doctor.  The criteria have been developed in collaboration with representatives of the specialty associations in infectious disease medicine, clinical microbiology, hygiene and infection control. These have most recently been discussed in the group at a meeting on 19 April 2021 due to the new virus variants. The assessment was then that no update was needed. The recommendations will be updated as new knowledge about covid-19 infectivity is added.  Related reading  Guidance for the use of antigen tests in covid-19",false
Rain fell at the normally snowy summit of Greenland for the first time on record,"(CNN) For the first time on record, precipitation on Saturday at the summit of Greenland — roughly two miles above sea level — fell as rain and not snow.  Temperatures at the Greenland summit over the weekend rose above freezing for the third time in less than a decade. The warm air fueled an extreme rain event that dumped 7 billion tons of water on the ice sheet, enough to fill the Reflecting Pool at the National Mall in Washington, DC, nearly 250,000 times.  It was the heaviest rainfall on the ice sheet since record keeping began in 1950, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center , and the amount of ice mass lost on Sunday was seven times higher than normal for this time of year.

Where’s Gov. Gavin Newsom?,"Two weeks ago, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he would be leading a delegation to the U.N. climate change summit in Scotland. Four days later, his office abruptly announced he had changed his mind.  “Family obligations” was all his office would say, refusing to publicly elaborate in a decision that, times being what they are, unleashed a barrage of conspiracy theories. Was the governor having a bad reaction to the Covid-19 booster shot he had just gotten? Were any of his children — he has four ages 12 and under — infected again with the coronavirus? No and no, Capitol sources said.  Allies of the governor noted that most parents would understand why a couple with four small children might not want to take an extended trip to Glasgow over Halloween. California environmentalists also suggested that he might not be so wrong to skip the annual climate conference, which many of them view as a jet-fuel-wasting spectacle.  In theory, California conservatives should also have welcomed the decision. When it appeared the governor might be summit-bound, Kevin Kiley, a Republican assemblyman who challenged the governor in the September recall election, wrote in a blog post that “in the absence of our jet-setting governor,” he was requesting a special session on the port crisis, holding oversight hearings on pandemic unemployment fraud, holding town hall events on the governor’s vaccine mandate for schoolchildren and calling for hearings on mask mandates in elementary school classrooms.",true
Daily coronavirus cases in Japan fall to the hundreds after a summer peak.,"In mid-August, Japan was recording over 20,000 daily coronavirus cases, its highest levels during the pandemic. On Wednesday, it reported just 310 nationwide.  About 70 percent of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated, the government announced Wednesday, and life in the country has returned to a state of cautious optimism and near normalcy from one of acute concern. Tokyo has lifted nearly all restrictions on daily life, and the subways, streets and shopping arcades are once again filled with people. The city has reported fewer than 50 daily cases for over a week.  Experts in Japan are unclear about what caused the precipitous drop in cases, although they agree that high vaccination levels and ubiquitous masking are probably the most important factors keeping the virus at bay.  In remarks to reporters on Wednesday, government experts said other factors, such as cooler weather, an effective testing regime and heightened caution during the recent surge in cases, may have also contributed to the sudden drop in cases.",true

Answers to Questions About the Texas Abortion Law,"A Texas law banning most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy went into effect on Wednesday, despite the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to the procedure, making the state the most restrictive in the nation in terms of access to abortion services.  Other states have passed similar laws, but those measures face legal challenges. The Texas law is the first to be implemented. On a vote of 5 to 4, the court refused just before midnight on Wednesday to block the law.  Because of the way the law was written, it may be difficult to challenge in court, representing a sea change in the battle over abortion rights and inviting imitation by other jurisdictions seeking to tamp down access to abortion.  “These laws are unconstitutional, as we have understood Supreme Court rulings until now, and courts have quickly issued preliminary injunctions blocking enforcement,” said Elizabeth Nash, state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",true

For some of his 130 million followers, it was a signal.  In the video, someone had posted a comment asking Mr. Bieber to touch his hat if he had been a victim of a child-trafficking ring known as PizzaGate. Thousands of comments were flooding in, and there was no evidence that Mr. Bieber had seen that message. But the pop star’s innocuous gesture set off a flurry of online activity, which highlighted the resurgence of one of social media’s early conspiracy theories.  Viewers quickly uploaded hundreds of videos online analyzing Mr. Bieber’s action. The videos were translated into Spanish, Portuguese and other languages, amassing millions of views. Fans then left thousands of comments on Mr. Bieber’s social media posts asking him if he was safe. Within days, searches for “Justin and PizzaGate” soared on Google, and the hashtag #savebieber started trending.  Four years ago, ahead of the 2016 presidential election, the baseless notion that Hillary Clinton and Democratic elites were running a child sex-trafficking ring out of a Washington pizzeria spread across the internet, illustrating how a crackpot idea with no truth to it could blossom on social media — and how dangerous it could be. In December 2016, a vigilante gunman showed up at the restaurant with an assault rifle and opened fire into a closet.",true
Scotland is the 'only country in the world' where the most popular drink isn’t Coca Cola,"Something went wrong, please try again later.  Get your weekly foodie fix with Glasgow Live's free food and drink newsletter  A map of the world showing just how much Coca Cola dominates the drinks industry has gone viral - all thanks to a bunch of proud Scots.  That’s because Scotland is singled out as the only country in the world where the most popular drink is NOT made by the Coca Cola company.  We’re sure you can guess which soft drink tops the charts here in Scotland instead, but just in case …  Barr’s Irn Bru shared the map, along with a single sassy emoji - and fans across the country are loving it.  The post has 21k likes and counting, with many of you sharing in a bid to big up the Bru.  Some, however, ask how accurate the map is - considering that Coca Cola famously cannot be bought or sold (at least officially) in Cuba and North Korea, both under long-term US trade embargoes.  Still, if it allows us to be proud of our other national drink here in Scotland, we’ll take Irn Bru’s moment of Twitter glory …",false
Rittenhouses File $60M Defamation Suit Against Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldgerg,"Kyle and his mom have pulled the trigger on a lawsuit against The View’s Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg. According to the family’s spokesman, Joe Barron, the Rittenhouses expect a quick and large settlement:  “The Rittenhouse family has been through hell at the hands of these evil Democrats. They were ripped apart on their partisan, biased opinion show and they will have retribution.”  Behar and Goldberg have repeatedly said that what Rittenhouse did was wrong, and Behar even said that his mother sent him across state lines with a gun. By our laws, the second she said that, the left became liars, and the Rittenhouses heroes. No matter what.  Then the verdict came, and the celebrities still showed disrespect towards the family on their constitutionally-protected free-speech television show. They can’t just do that. By our rules, once Kyle was free, everything he did was sanctioned by Jesus and precedent for all other kids who want to play soldier medic during dangerous social situations they should probably just stay out of.  So now, Kyle gets to sue everyone. I mean it, too.

Bill Clinton Dead at GITMO,"Former President William Jefferson Clinton, whom on July 24 the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps sentenced to life in prison at Guantanamo Bay, was found dead in his cell early Saturday morning.  Sources at the nation’s most infamous detention center told RRN that GITMO security discovered Clinton’s lifeless body at approximately 7:00 a.m., when they were delivering breakfast trays to segregated prisoners.  “He was face down on the floor in a pool of what appeared to be his own vomit,” a GITMO source told RRN. “Security called out to him several times, and when he didn’t respond, guards and a medical technician entered the cell to check his vitals. He had no pulse and was declared deceased.”  Clinton was alive the night earlier at head check and lights out, our source added.  “He ate his 6:00 p.m. meal and was alive on his bunk at 9:00 p.m.,” our source said. “Bill Clinton is in a segregated area and no other GITMO inmates have access to his cell. He was in reasonably good health.”  Guantanamo Bay medical staff have scheduled an autopsy for Monday, September 27.  “His wife was executed, and if, somehow, he’d learned his daughter was arrested, it might have been too much for him to handle. He may have punched out on his own, some way. We’ll know more Monday,” our source said.  (Visited 92,417 times, 16,345 visits today)",false

Miami stripper arrested for squirting vaginal fluids at police officers in self-defense,"A Florida lap dancer has been arrested in Miami after assaulting five police officers with her vagina and using it as a deadly weapon without the intent to kill.  Britney Simmons, 24, was performing at the Camel Toe strip club when an altercation began between Simmons and several clients at the club.  Miami police were called to intervene and attempted to apprehend Simmons who was highly intoxicated and acting erratically according to the official police report.  Five Miami Police Department officers attempted to place Simmons under arrest but were momentarily indisposed when the lap dancer ejected vaginal fluids towards the officers, temporarily blinding three and injuring two.  “She just spread her legs wide open and started squirting in the cops’ faces, eyes and mouths from a distance of about twelve to fifteen feet,” one eyewitness told reporters, visibly amused by the whole affair.  “Knowing full well that she was exposing the police officers to a number of sexually transmitted diseases and potentially HIV as well, it is considered that she used her vagina with lethal force against the officers” explained Miguel Aguera, spokesman for the Miami Police Department.  Simmons’s attorney, Alan Smith, argued that his client acted in self-defense and used her vagina, not as a deadly weapon, but in the “appropriate boundaries of her working skills and abilities.”  According to current Florida laws and if convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon against five police officers, Simmons could face up to 1,036 years in jail believe legal experts.  In a 2013 court case, another Miami citizen was convicted of armed robbery after threatening a convenient store clerk with his erect and “AIDS-infected penis” and was sentenced to 237 years in jail.",false

Federal Magistrate Approves Kyle Rittenhouse’s $110 Million Defamation Suit Against LeBron James,"When Kyle Rittenhouse said he was going to sue LeBron James, “The King” responded by laughing and saying no judge in Cleveland would side with the little “white supremacist.” Kyle, in return, apparently asked his lawyers to file in federal court.  The first step to a federal civil suit is to have the case approved by a magistrate, which isn’t easy to do. You have to prove that the case is “in the interest of all the peoples of the several states” as it says in the Constitution, Article 17.  The Rittenhouse suit is satisfied because Kyle wasn’t in Cleveland, nor was he a resident of Cleveland, or Kenosha, when the alleged incident of white supremacy occured.  Remember, folks. Being photographed with white supremacists and being a white supremacist are two different things, or have we all forgotten the Tea Party mantras about Hillary Clinton and Larry Byrd?  So the magistrate, the Honorable Joe Barron of the 7th Federal Court of Writs and Warrants, has stamped the case, greenlighting it to be filed anywhere in the country.  According to Kyle’s lawyer, they plan to file it in one federal court in each state, just to be safe.  Checkmate, LeBron. Looks like you have no clue how things actually work.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal masking in schools this fall.,"The American Academy of Pediatrics issued new Covid-19 guidelines for schools on Monday, recommending that everyone over age 2 wear masks this fall, even if they have been vaccinated. Exceptions may be made for those with medical or developmental conditions that complicate mask wearing, the group said.  The universal masking recommendation is a departure from the guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this month, which recommends masking in schools only for unvaccinated people over age 2. Those guidelines heavily implied that fully vaccinated children and adults would not need to wear masks in the classroom — although they also said that individual schools were free to implement universal mask mandates.  In many other ways, however, the two sets of guidelines are similar. The A.A.P., like the C.D.C., emphasized the importance of returning to in-person learning.  “We need to prioritize getting children back into schools alongside their friends and their teachers — and we all play a role in making sure it happens safely,” Dr. Sonja O’Leary, the chair of the A.A.P.

""We don't automatically disable accounts across our apps, because the accounts may post about different things on our different services,"" the spokesperson said.  The environmental activist and son of former US attorney general Robert F Kennedy has repeated a false claim that the recent death of baseball legend Hank Aaron was linked to the Covid-19 vaccine.  He had previously posted misinformation about the flu vaccine.  Kennedy frequently has gotten involved in controversial issues and personalities, speaking last summer to a massive demonstration in Berlin of coronavirus deniers organized by the far right, and joining forces with Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez to provide heating oil to poor Americans.  Facebook also removed several other accounts from the two sites for spreading vaccine disinformation.  hs/cs",true
Coronavirus updates: Fauci calls 'herd immunity' declaration embraced by White House 'ridiculous',"""This idea that we have the power to protect the vulnerable is total nonsense.""  A pandemic of the novel coronavirus has now killed more than 1 million people worldwide.  Over 38.8 million people across the globe have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The criteria for diagnosis -- through clinical means or a lab test -- has varied from country-to-country. Still, the actual numbers are believed to be much higher due to testing shortages, many unreported cases and suspicions that some national governments are hiding or downplaying the scope of their outbreaks.  Since the first cases were detected in China in December, the virus has rapidly spread to every continent except Antarctica.  The United States is the worst-affected country, with more than 7.9 million diagnosed cases and at least 217,721 deaths.  California has the most cases of any U.S. state, with more than 866,000 people diagnosed, according to Johns Hopkins data. California is followed by Texas and Florida, with over 836,000 cases and over 744,000 cases, respectively.  More than 190 vaccine candidates for COVID-19 are being tracked by the World Health Organization, at least 10 of which are in crucial phase three studies. Of those 10 potential vaccines in late-stage trials, there are currently five that will be available in the United States if approved.",true

138 Migrants Sent Back to El Salvador by the U.S. Were Killed,"At least 138 migrants and asylum seekers from El Salvador who were deported by the United States have been killed after returning home, according to a new report by Human Rights Watch. The humanitarian group followed 200 migrant cases over a two year period and found that 138 of those deported were murdered and the rest were either raped or tortured—often by the same gangs they were originally fleeing from. The report, called Deported to Danger: United States deportation policies expose Salvadorans to death and abuse, also found that nearly 11,000 people were registered as missing during the decade. “The United States has to have known this was happening because the cases were publicly reported and more importantly because Salvadorans make it clear in asylum applications that this is their reality,” Elizabeth Kennedy, co-author of the report said in a statement. “But this reality is ignored or not believed by U.S. authorities.” Editor’s Note: This cheat has been updated after incorrectly stating that the majority of migrants and asylum seekers from El Salvador who were deported by the United States have been killed, raped or tortured.",false

While this claim was quickly shot down by “fact checkers,” it continues to circulate on social media and on blogs.

Myanmar Military Truck With Soldiers on Board Blown Up in Yangon,"an army truck with regime soldiers on board was blown up in Yangon’s Tamwe Township on Friday afternoon in the most serious attack to date on a junta target in the city. Witnesses said they saw soldiers on board the truck, which was parked outside an office of the military proxy Union Solidarity and Development Party, before the explosion. The blast occurred within walking distance of the township’s police station. The blast at around 3:25 p.m. rocked the whole neighborhood. Local people saw a plume of black smoke snaking up toward the sky while the vehicle was completely engulfed in flames.
